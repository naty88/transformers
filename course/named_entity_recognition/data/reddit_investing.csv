t3_139yfid|1683398660|investing|Low-end primary residence vs index stock portfolio annual yield?|"This is quite anecdotal, and only applies to specific situations such as the example below, but I'm going to ask anyway.

Let's consider a low-end primary residence at which you yourself will reside. Let's say a $150,000 house (obviously where such a liveable house can be bought, say Iowa), and let's assume you have 150k cash to buy it directly with no loan.

It is generally accepted that over time real-estate value grows by around 5% annually (let's ignore recent years where the value grew disproportionately, around 12% YoY).

Now, the way I see it, you would be saving at least $800 of rent per month on such a property which is 9,600 a year - **theoretically after tax**, so let's assume this amount is actually worth around $12,000 (assuming 20% tax was imposed on the general earnings, say from selling stocks, before they were used to theoretically pay rent).

A house as such (150k) should cost around $3,000 in property taxes and basic annual maintenance, I suppose, so I will deduct that amount.

To summarize the *theoretical* gains, the property should yield around ((5,000 + 12,000) - 3,000) = $14,000 annually before tax.

Now the [historical] general expected earnings from the stock market should be around 8% (again, here too, I am discounting the past few years), so around $12,000 before tax for a 150k index portfolio.

Now I know these numbers are nowhere near perfect, and this is quite a specific situation, but generally, it seems to me that if you have the cash and the will to live in a lower-end property which is purchased without a loan, it's worth more than holding index funds in the stock market and renting said property.

t3_139wt3y|1683395120|investing|Would the demystification and increase in public trust in the stock market cause a decrease in returns and perception of its risk (short term or long term)?|"There are a couple of factors I'm thinking of: 

- as the market's history and positive track record increases 
- as education and access to information increases, especially via the Internet
- the accessibility of investing, with the increase of accessible tools with user friendly interfaces 

Those factors seem to lead to increasing trust in the stock market's returns. Does this lead people to view the risk in the stock market to be much less? Would this impact returns in any way? Short term or long term. 

The last two factors can be counter productive. There's a lot or misinformation, and some investing tools make it too easy to fuck up. But that doesn't change the other effect of more people investing wisely and trusting the market better.

The way I understand it, which may be wrong, is that the risk / uncertainty involved is a big contribution to a stock's price. As time goes on, some of that uncertainty becomes certain. A company does indeed make positive earnings, etc., and the uncertainty about this event disappears, increasing the value of the stock.

If people view returns on the stock market to be more certain than they used to 50 years ago, then the discount due to risk is reduced, right? People are willing to pay more for a similar amount of risk, just because their own perception of it is that it is less risky.

t3_139ao01|1683343717|investing|US-only portfolio safe or not in next 10 years?|"Investing in US market has been a guaranteed win for the past 50 years or so, as long as you put money in every month for 20 years. But recently I read about potential problems everywhere, like high inflation, real estate collapse, yearly debt default debate, etc. And the most dangerous thing is that the Petrodollar might be in danger, and more countries might want to join China and friends org (BRICS). Also I see news about social problems everywhere (mass Walmart looting, increasingly frequent shooting, rising sea level = goodbye Florida, California water shortage =  mass unrest in 20 years, etc).

**Is it normal to assume the US will always win and we'll fix all those problems later?** Currently I don't see anywhere more stable than US markets; Europe has dying population problem + too strict laws = little innovation (which end-user tech products have you been using that come from Europe?), so I'd rather select manually a few stocks there instead of buying broad-market ETFs. Other international markets are kinda sketchy (rip $BABA), and subject to geopolitical changes.

But I can't say the US economy is currently safe. **Its debt is insane and will only keep increasing**. If the government keep (practically) printing money, it's possible it won't be the global currency anymore because ""why does the US get to control the entire world's money""? The USD has been the global reserve currency for many generations, so I can't imagine what effects it might have.

**So, is it worth it for young people (let's say globally, since everyone has access to international stock brokers now) to diversify internationally?** Or should people should stick to a safe US-only portfolio\* ?

t3_1397w9s|1683336338|investing|New Valuation Model Question|"Me and my good friend ChatGPT created a valuation model. GPT seems to like it, as whenever I try to explain why it might be irrational, it disregards it. Here it is:

Intrinsic Market Cap = ((Total Assets - Total Liabilities) \* ((1+Annualized Equity Growth Rate)\^10)) + ((Free Cash Flow \* ((1+Annualized FCF Growth Rate)\^10)) \* Historical FCF Multiple))/(1.1\^10)

Really this is just a spinoff of the classic predicting future cash flows and discounting it, only it also takes into account shareholder's equity. To me, it doesn't make sense because it seems the intrinsic value is making the investor pay twice, once for shareholder's equity and another for the FCF multiple. I do like that it takes into account the growth of shareholder's equity, but not that it takes into the value of the whole equity. To refute this, ChatGPT shows me that I am in fact the irrational one as the intrinsic value is near real market cap for stocks that are said to be near fair value.

I am restarting my investing strategy in my Roth from the ground up. I’ve been doing a lot of reading, researching, and back testing (I understand past performance is not a guarantee of future). I want to reach out for others advice, opinions or anything you would change about my current thoughts on how to set up my portfolio. We are talking on a 30 to 40 year timeline here. I had two ideas I can’t decide on.

Idea #1:

VTI - 70%
VEA - 10%
VWO - 10%
VIOV or VBR - 10%

I’m not sure if this is even a decent allocation/weighting but it felt right to me. I couldn’t decide between VIOV or VBR. I know they track different indexes and VBR has a lower fee. This portfolio would be a cheaper alternative fee wise.

Idea #2:

VTI - 60%
VEA - 10%
AVEM - 10%
AVUV - 10%
AVDV* - 10%

I definitely think I could live without AVDV and just add 5% to VTI and the other 5% to AVUV. This portfolio definitely carry’s higher expense ratios but I have somewhat bought into the Avantis investing strategy and active management. I also sought AVEM over AVES but would appreciate any advise on why you wouldn’t pick that. I am a bit more aggressive here but I do believe in Avantis funds long term. I am also unsure on whether emerging markets is necessary. 

As you can see I am trying to tilt certain areas, specifically SCV. I also value at least a 20% up to 30% international position as this is a buy and hold portfolio and anything could happen in the next few decades. I tried not to weight anything lower than 10% or do 5% weighted funds as that seemed pointless to me from what I have read.

Please let me know what you think. Would you change the weighting? The tilts? Add or subtract any funds? Which idea would you go with, #1 or #2? I am so torn on these options. I will probably post this in a few subs to gather advice. Thank you all in advance."|0.68|5|0|5

t3_1384l5f|1683245002|investing|Investing in Terminally Old Industries|"Investing in new and growing industries makes obvious sense to people. You buy the business now, it grows, and now you have an identical percentage ownership of a larger company. However, the average returns of investing in new industries is a lot less than you think as new investors are an issue. That is, companies grow quickly by taking on debt and/or equity funding which is not only risky but decreases earnings per share.

The drag debt causes on returns is obvious, as money is spent on interest payments that could be returned to investors in some fashion. People like equity investments because it tends to hide that risk by shifting it onto a new investor, but it has the same effect on stock performance. If you receive equity funding, your percentage ownership instantly shrinks and there is no guarantee that the business will grow to compensate.

Look at the opposite end of things, with industries expected to terminate in the foreseeable future. Remember; Someone was breeding horses when the car was invented, and had to find a new way to make money. You might think these guys will just go out of business one by one and be forced to sell all their possessions, but often the best performing stocks on the market are the end-of-life stocks.

1. They have ""low cost of capital."" They're using the same assets (buildings, equipment, funds) they always have meaning they don't need to get expensive debt or equity funding to keep making money.
2. They have been profitable for a long time and often have savings in the form of stocks and bonds.
3. They can pay generous share buybacks or dividends.

Remember: All we care about is earnings-per-share, and with terminally old industries you will see a diminishing number of investors as companies buy back their own shares. Yes, the share price can keep going up even as a company sells off its buildings.

There was a statistical study done of where all the shares in the market were since all shares are owned by someone. It found that risky pre-profit companies were preferentially held by active fund managers of all sorts, while obscure and old companies were preferentially held by quant and arbitrage funds using math to turn a profit. The funny thing is, the quants are the ones holding shares perceived as trash, but the star fund managers are the ones holding shares that are actually trash.

This isn't intended to give any sort of fund recommendation, I say this to show how in a fully efficient market it simply does not matter what is old or new or what is obsolete and what is high-tech, because all risk and rewards are priced into the market."|0.55|2|0|2

I don't want to talk politics here beyond the objective facts. Republicans want spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, and Democrats want the debt ceiling raised without any conditions. Representatives from both sides stringently say they're unwilling to compromise at all. They're even explicitly unwilling to pass a short-term debt ceiling raise to allow more time for discussions. I know this is (unfortunately) not exactly out of the ordinary.

However, what's starting to worry me about today's situation is that both sides are instead looking at ways they can circumvent the other, seeming to be the latest strategy in today's historically divided politics. House Democrats took the next step in starting a discharge petition for a debt-ceiling increase, a move that could allow them to go around Republican leaders. The White House is looking at ""experimental ways"" to keep the government paying its bills without a debt ceiling increase, like suspending payments to Social Security, military contractors, etc, issuing short-term high-interest rate bonds, or issuing debt ""under the 14th amendment."" I just don't think there's enough time in one month to do this dance and I'm afraid of the horrendous outcome a default could make, in addition to all the other economic headwinds we're facing.

&gt;China is putting the yuan front and center in its fight back against the US's unique influence over global money.

&gt;President Xi Jinping's government has been busy striking deals over the past year to expand the ways in which the currency is used, with new agreements linked to the renminbi stretching from Russia and Saudi Arabia to Brazil and even France. 

&gt;While the US remains the world’s clear financial hegemon, these moves are helping China to carve out a bigger place for itself in the international financial system. They come at a time when geopolitical strains are growing and global commerce is becoming an ever-more-active battleground.

&gt;Antagonism has flared between the two economic titans over issues ranging from trade and Taiwan to TikTok and technological know-how. Hard-hitting sanctions on Russia have revealed a new willingness by the US to weaponize the dollar. Together, that's done more to promote China's yuan over the past year than Xi’s government achieved in the preceding decade. 

&gt;The ramp-up is also a response to China’s shifting position within the global economy as it emerges from the era of Covid-lockdowns with growth running more slowly than it once did and the global push for freer trade in retreat. That's spurred leaders in Beijing to up the ante in building the country — and in particular its currency — into an alternative pole for international finance, trade and lending.

&gt;The nation is working to demonstrate “that there’s a world outside of the US and the Western world,” said Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation and co-head of global investment management for the Asia-Pacific region at UBS Global Wealth Management’s office in Hong Kong. ""You're sending a very strong signal to the US by basically saying we don't need you and we don't need your US dollar.""

&gt;That message is resonating in some parts of the world. Unease with the dominance of the US and the greenback is pushing some countries and companies to diversify away from America and Europe.

&gt;The use of the renminbi in contracts for everything from oil to nickel is gathering speed, with the currency’s share of global trade finance tripling since the end of 2019. That's still a tiny portion of global transactions, and the currency remains tightly controlled by Chinese authorities. But sanctions that ensnared Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine have added to that pace. The yuan’s usage in Russian export payments surged 32-fold last year alone.

&gt;Going Global

&gt;Xi, who is embarking on his second decade in charge of the People’s Republic, has taken steps to promote the country’s  reputation abroad, even as he focuses on implementing reforms and bolstering growth at home. His first foreign excursions after lifting lockdowns were to key energy suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia.

&gt;Trips to Beijing by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and France’s Emmanuel Macron were accompanied by a host of new commercial agreements. And China was central to brokering an Iran-Saudi detente.

&gt;With the US, though, flashpoints have multiplied — from feuds over spy balloons to semiconductor technology.

&gt;The ostracism of Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has provided China with an important opening to demonstrate just how the yuan can be used. It also stoked concern among some nations about being beholden to the dollar and the euro, the two biggest currencies.

&gt;Locked out of the central international payments system known as SWIFT, Russia embraced the yuan for trade, private savings and foreign-exchange transactions. China has developed its own international-payments platform — CIPS — that’s entirely separate from SWIFT, which has been embraced not only by institutions in Russia, but also by banks that operate in places like Brazil.

&gt;“China's willingness to maintain growth while paving new paths lends itself for other nations to have greater confidence to use the yuan,’’ said Victor Gao, a professor at Soochow University and vice president of think tank Center for China and Globalization. “If the US wants to rock the boat, then China will need to make necessary amendments to meet the challenges.’’

&gt;Neither the People’s Bank of China nor the country’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange immediately responded to faxes seeking comment.

&gt;Russian Experiment

&gt;The seeds of Russia’s move toward the yuan were planted back in 2014, when the annexation of Crimea prompted the US and its allies to threaten Moscow’s access to the mainstream financial system. But it was the full-blown invasion of Ukraine last year that fast-tracked China’s acceptance.

&gt;Yuan savings accounted for 11% of Russia’s total deposits as of January, compared with practically none before the war, and the yuan has replaced the dollar and euro as the most traded currency from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok.

&gt;Russia and others have also begun to use the yuan in transactions that don’t even involve China. Bangladesh, for example, agreed with Russia last month to settle a $300 million payment related to the building of a nuclear plant near Dhaka in renminbi, according to officials familiar with the matter.

&gt;The Chinese currency has made major inroads into all walks of Russian financial life since the war in Ukraine broke out

&gt;As oil income helps Russia’s public finances to stabilize, the nation may even be looking to buy yuan in an effort to rebuild foreign reserves.

&gt;But there are limits to the experiment. The Kremlin has been left with very few choices, and China’s financial offerings still struggle to compete. Without deep capital markets or open capital accounts, it can be difficult to move money in and out of the country — a complaint longtime investor Mark Mobius voiced earlier this year. 
Yuan’s Hurdles

&gt;The lack of deep, free markets is a hindrance if China really wanted to take on the dollar or euro as the global currency of choice. 

&gt;A fully international yuan “can’t happen unless China allows greater freedom of the currency and inward as well as outward investment,” said Jim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief economist who coined the term BRICs more than two decades ago to describe what were then the four big emerging-market powerhouses with potential to challenge the existing economic order.

&gt;Even with the drumbeat of international deals, the currency is not fully convertible. There are restrictions on its use in areas such as cross-border loans and portfolio investments.

&gt;Limitations on the variety of renminbi-based investment products — and the simple inertia that stems from sticking with the prevailing reserve currency — are also major impediments to the yuan becoming broadly accepted as an alternative to the dollar.

&gt;“There’s still a long way to go for China to build up its global clout,” said Chen Xingdong, head of global markets research in China at BNP Paribas SA.

&gt;In the first few decades of this century, China has taken steps to open up stock and bond markets to encourage inbound investment and loosened some of the strictures around its managed currency. But Xi's government has resisted broader measures that would encourage international yuan usage — such as allowing capital to flow freely — to avoid the possibility of sudden outflows that stand to potentially destabilize the economy and threaten the Communist Party's grip on power.

&gt;“There's so much money queuing up from China to go outside, and there's probably a limit on how much outside money is queuing to go back in,” said UBS’s Zuercher. “Controlling capital flows is still extremely important.""
One story you'll want to talk about.

&gt;The renminbi is only the fifth-most popular currency for cross-border payments. Excluding payments between countries that share the euro, China’s currency accounted for 1.7% of cross-border payments at the end of March, compared to around 50% for the dollar and 22% for Europe’s common currency, according to data from SWIFT. That, of course, doesn’t include transactions made via China’s CIPS alternative, but that system as a whole is still dwarfed by the mainstream SWIFT platform. 

&gt;Diversification Demand

&gt;Still, for those in China itself, the usage of the yuan in international transactions has just recently surpassed the dollar, according to research from Bloomberg Intelligence and based on State Administration of Foreign Exchange data.

&gt;The local currency’s share of cross-border payments and receipts hit a record high of 48% at the end of March, compared with almost zero back in 2010, while the dollar’s share dropped to 47%.

&gt;Even with the the dollar’s dominance relatively entrenched for years to come, some observers speculate that the greenback is headed for a longer-term decline. The events giving life to yuan usage right now may ultimately be a key contributor.

&gt;Repercussions from Russia’s war have made other nations anxious about the risk of US-led sanctions, said Esther Law, a senior money manager at Amundi SA. She expects the yuan to continue rising in popularity amid the fear of US-led sanctions and as a “practical” part of China’s growing role as a lender.

&gt;The perk of diversification also applies to China. There’s safety in having standing arrangements with a plethora of trading partners in case simmering tensions with the US turn to a boil. 

&gt;“Geopolitical tensions just make it that much more important for China to promote the international use of its own currency,” said Stephen Jen, co-founder of Eurizon SLJ Capital. “There is a war of attrition now between the US and China, in investment and finance.”"|0.31|0|0|0

Under the terms of the termination agreement, TD will make a $200 million cash payment to First Horizon.  This payment is in addition to the $25 million fee reimbursement due to First Horizon pursuant to the merger agreement.  The shares of First Horizon Series G Preferred Stock that TD Bank purchased will continue to reflect a conversion price of $25 per share.  Neither party will pay any other fees or have any other liabilities to each other related to the merger agreement.

""While today's announcement is unfortunate and unexpected, First Horizon will continue on its growth path operating from a position of strength and stability,"" said First Horizon Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Bryan Jordan. ""Our strong capital position, disciplined credit quality, expense control measures, and well-diversified and stable funding mix have enabled our business to navigate challenging banking industry dynamics and remain focused on executing our client-centric growth plan. We continue to develop and expand deep client relationships across all of our markets, which include some of the fastest-growing U.S. markets, while maintaining a strong, asset-sensitive balance sheet well-positioned for the current rate environment.""

""This decision provides our colleagues and shareholders with clarity.  Though disappointed with the outcome, we move forward with a strong, growing franchise in the United States, servicing more than 10 million customers across our footprint."" said Bharat Masrani, Group President and Chief Executive Officer, TD Bank Group.  ""I want to thank First Horizon for their partnership over the last several months and wish them enormous success for the future.  Above all, I want to thank our colleagues at TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank, for their tremendous efforts and steadfast dedication to the Bank, the millions we serve and the communities in which we live and work.""

t3_137fpng|1683193473|investing|Retail Investor Sites Like Motley Fool, InvestorPlace and Income Trust Went Full Hog Promoting Icahn Enterprises LP (IEP), Touting Its 15% Dividend Yield|"Just finished reading the entire Hindenburg piece on Icahn's eponymous company, Icahn Enterprises LP (IEP).  Here is really the crucial question:  does Hindenburg have a strong case?  Why does IEP continue to trade so much above its net asset value (NAV): 218% at the time.  After the stock fell to $32.57 from $51.48 after the report came out, the NAV premium is now 106%.  Still the highest but Mario Gabelli's Gabelli Utility Trust is nipping Carl's heel at 103% now (when will Hindenburg do its report on Gabelli?  2 of his funds are among the top 5 in premiums commanded by closed-end funds.)

According to Hindenburg, the answer for the exorbitant premium commanded by IEP has to do with 2 reasons:  (1) the Icahn name and mystique built on years of activist investing and corporate raiding career; and (2) the inordinately high dividend yield -- 15.5% prior to the fall and now even higher at 25%.  The eye-popping dividend yield is hooking gullible retail investors in.  There is the familiar culprit in Jefferies, which is Icahn's chosen investment banker for continuous offerings, bka at the money (ATM) offerings.  However, whenever you wanna confuse and addle retail investors, there are these paper mills that spew misinformation:  we're talking about low-quality investing sites tailored to the retail money like Motley Fool, InvestorPlace, YahooFinance and another site which I had never heard of before, Income Investors.

Remember, ""dividend investing"" has been the mantra for retiring baby-boomers that want to live off of qualified dividends.  They typically gravitate to income mutual funds or dividend aristocrat ETFs like SCHD, VYM, VIG and COWZ.  None of these mainstream ETFs are in IEP but it's not surprising to find smaller and obscure names like Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF and Global X Guru Index ETF as holders of IEP.

In July 2022, that was only 10 months ago, the king of retail bullsheet site Motley Fool was gushing that IEP was topping the total return of Buffett's Berkshire shares: ""IEP is a rock solid dividend play with an all star manager at the helm, making it a must own stock in this turbulent market.""  Motley Fool followed that up with another puff piece in October 2022, which gushed that IEP has “ultra-high dividend yields, fundamentally strong businesses, and a proven ability to generate healthy levels of free cash flows in an uncertain economic environment.”   How would Motley Fool know IEP has fundamentally strong businesses?

Another retail site InvestorPlace, was promoting IEP among 3 stocks to buy “with your social security increase” because of its 14.8% dividend at the time.  Another retail site devoted to income investing, Income Investors, put out this red-lipstick-on-pig-lips marketing pitch:  ""If you are an income hog who wants to see your underlying investment rise, IEP might be a smart option right now""!  Who is not an income hog?

Do these sites even know how difficult it is to value closed-end funds like IEP that disclose limited details on valuation metrics used?  But per Hindenburg, the guiltiest party is still Jefferies, which is blatantly trying to hook retails investors in with its ponzi scam of continuous ATM offerings.  Here is how the ponzi scam works:  Jefferies has helped to sell $1.7 billion in IEP units to support dividend payments.  This is possible because Icahn, who owns 85% of IEP, is taking dividends in units, not cash.  In other words, the existing investors of IEP, i.e., the 15%, are being paid with the retail cash inflow from the offerings while the new ones will wait their turn.  It's the greater fool theory applied to a dividend aristocrat as IEP does not have the FCF to pay dividends; Jefferies, through its ATM offerings, is enabling the payout to the next fool who will, at some point, end up holding the bag.

So why does Hindenburg think Icahn and Jefferies are specifically targeting retail investors?  Aren't all investors, including institutional, pension funds, hedge funds, ETFs all into income investing?  There isn't a single noteworthy institutional investor in IEP, except passive ETFs and retail-oriented investors like Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd.  Plus not one serious research house is covering IEP except Jefferies.

And for many retail investors, the Icahn name still carries mystique: a titan of Wall Street who drives a hard bargain with management to walk away with windfalls and premiums.  However, it seems Icahn really isn't very good at running businesses or picking stocks like Buffett or Munger.  He's really only good at acting irascible, agitating for shareholder value and browbeating management, not creating or even managing value.  "|0.7|4|0|4

PACW down 58% and WAL down 29%. There's also a Time article today discussing possibility of domino effect among regional banks.|"I noticed these 2 stocks down hard in after-hours today so looked into what the cause is, which is a Bloomberg News article, citing ""people familiar with the matter"":

* [PacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible Sale](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/pacwest-said-to-weigh-strategic-options-including-possible-sale) Bloomberg News. May 3, 2023.

FTA:

&gt; PacWest Bancorp., a regional bank teetering following the collapse of three rival California-based lenders, has been weighing a range of strategic options, including a sale, according to people familiar with the matter. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Beverly Hills-based bank has been working with a financial adviser and has also been considering a breakup or a capital raise, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. While it is open to a sale, the company hasn’t started a formal auction process, the people said.


MarketWatch cites this Bloomberg report as the cause of the afterhours drop:

* [PacWest stock plummets more than 50% after report of potential sale, other bank stocks join in decline](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pacwest-stock-plummets-more-than-50-after-report-of-potential-sale-other-bank-stocks-join-in-decline-dbb89ee) MarketWatch. May 3, 2023.

FTA:

&gt; PacWest Bancorp PACW shares dove more than 50% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after a report that the company’s executives are looking at a possible sale. The regional bank’s shares have been diving this week after the collapse and sale of another regional bank in the western U.S., First Republic Bank, which was sold to JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM Monday in a deal that netted shareholders nothing. Bloomberg News reported Wednesday afternoon that PacWest’s leaders were considering strategic alternatives of their own, which could include a sale, based on anonymous sources.


A related article from Time Magazine today talks about problems with regional banks. Check out this alarmist-sounding headline from just a few hours ago, giving analysis on what the Fed's rate hike today can possibly mean:

* [The Fed's Latest Interest Rate Hike Could Set Off a 'Domino Effect' in Regional Bank Failures](https://time.com/6276744/fed-interest-rate-hike-bank-failures/) Time Magazine. May 3, 2023.

FTA:

&gt; Analysts say that the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates again has renewed concerns that some midsize or regional banks that have suffered large withdrawals of deposits could be on the edge of a precipice. “Each incremental interest rate hike beyond what they had anticipated is going to exacerbate the banking problem significantly,” says Brian Bethune, a financial economist and economics professor at Boston College. “Once that trust starts to erode, then you have a domino effect. And we’re on the brink right now of a major domino effect in the regional banks.”

I'm just looking at PACW and WAL right now, as they're good enough indicators for me, but if anyone feels like putting in an entire list of regional bank stocks to watch, that would be great.

P.S. - Interesting times.

Edit: Today, the next day on May 4, a [Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-futures-slip-as-regional-banks-tank-stock-market-news-today-115208499.html) says there's a Financial Times report about Western Alliance (WAL) looking for a potential sale to raise money. This explains the drop in that stock:

&gt;The US Treasury’s unexpectedly quick rollout of a program to buy back some outstanding debt securities suggests officials hope it will improve trading in the world’s biggest bond market.

&gt;The Treasury on Wednesday said that it will begin “regular and predictable” purchases of Treasuries sometime in the 2024 calendar year in the first buyback program since 2000.

&gt;Most dealers hadn’t expected an announcement so soon, amid continuing discussions between officials and market participants over how a program would be structured.

&gt;Unlike the last time, the new plan isn’t a side-effect of budget surpluses. The Treasury launched the previous initiative as a way of retiring some outstanding, higher-interest securities as it enjoyed an historic period of tax revenues outpacing spending.

&gt;Today, the federal government is running large deficits. But other challenges have cropped up in the $24 trillion Treasuries market. One is that regulations put in place after the global financial crisis requiring banks to set aside capital against Treasuries trading have left them less willing to engage in market-making.
Vulnerable Market

&gt;Analysts say that’s left the market vulnerable to bouts of illiquidity, especially for Treasuries that are no longer the current benchmarks — so-called off-the-runs. 

&gt;One of the two main aspects of the new buyback program will be to support liquidity, by purchasing older outstanding securities and selling more of current benchmarks.

&gt;The second main purpose, the Treasury said in Wednesday’s statement, will be to help with “cash management.” The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, or TBAC — a panel of investors, dealers and other market participants that regularly counsels the Treasury — has highlighted that the department’s sales of Treasury bills can be volatile as revenues and outlays fluctuate.

&gt;When the Treasury receives a big influx of revenue, as with tax receipts when annual filings are due in April, its cash balance surges and it cuts back its bill issuance. A buyback program would offer the Treasury the option of smoothing out bill issuance, while using large inflows of cash for buybacks.

&gt;“Operations will likely split into two categories: liquidity support for longer maturities (greater than one year), and cash management for maturities up to two years” Deutsche Bank AG Steven Zeng wrote in a note to clients.

&gt;The Treasury said that buybacks will “initially sized conservatively, and not intended to meaningfully change the overall maturity profile of marketable debt outstanding.” It added it will conduct more consultations. 

&gt;Stephen Stanley, chief US economist at Santander US Capital Markets LLC, noted that TBAC had indicated that the Treasury discussed “proposed sizing of ‘up to $240 billion per year,’ but it sounds like it would begin smaller and ramp up to that.”

&gt;Stanley said that Santander’s trading desk has highlighted one challenge: During its pandemic-driven quantiative easing program. the Federal Reserve amassed such a large stockpile of Treasuries that there may be limited volumes available of short-dated interest bearing securities for the Treasury to buy back.

&gt;Zeng at Deutsche Bank still suggested the program might help. It could achieve an outcome of “enhancing Treasury market liquidity especially for off-the-runs,” he wrote."|0.96|81|0|81

It was also involved in managing continuous offerings, i.e., at the money offerings (ATM), of IEP worth about $1.7 billion. Icahn and JEF have a long history and Icahn bailed out Jefferies (JEF) when it got into illiquid sovereign debt issues which were falling fast in value (read Hindenburg's tweets). So the two have been scratching each other's back for a while.

Another sell-side firm that used to cover IEP was UBS, which dropped coverage in January 2020 citing ""lack of transparency, limited float ..."" among some of the reasons: of course one inevitable result of the lack of transparency was the significant premium above the net asset value at which IEP was trading. That premium was only about 60% according to UBS in early 2020.

Hindenburg calculates the fair value of IEP's current NAV at $4.4 billion. IEP's market cap is $14.3 billion right now, after falling from $18.6 billion prior to Hindenburg's report. Based on market cap, IEP is trading 325% above Hindenburg's estimated NAV.

IEP has also been paying out $2 per share in dividend which, annualized, is $2 x 4 = $8; $8 divided by current stock price of $40.36 = 20%. This was apparently a big lure for the retail money: IEP was paying out divvies like certain Brazilian conglomerates. However, if IEP was properly marked to market at $4.4 billion, which is equivalent to a stock price of only $12.44, then the dividend yield jacks up to $8 / $12.44 = 64.3%. Clearly unsustainable but enabled for the moment by JEF's management of IEP's ATM offerings (hence the accusation, ""malpractice""). The inordinate dividend will have to be cut as the market continues to tank and Icahn's market bets have soured -- he was shorting in 2022, which should have made him money. But he was apparently shorting the wrong stocks, and was on track to lose more than $250mm, ouch.

Forbes estimates Icahn has 85% of his wealth tied up in IEP, so he can't really deploy further capital into IEP, Hindenburg reckons. Also, IEP is hobbled by too much leverage -- net debt of $5.2 billion. When IEP's market equity drops to $4.4 billion, that translates to 54% debt in the capital structure -- this will surely kickstart covenant breaches in some debt indentures. Things won't end well for Icahn, thinks Hindenburg. Bill Ackman is piling in, rubbing it in, and observing, ""There is a karmic quality to this short report that reinforces the notion of a circle of life and death. As such, it is a must read.""  There is no love lost when talking about death.

Incidentally JEF is a Buffett stock but he has a very small stake (for BH) in the brokerage company: only $15 million. This does not mean the rest of the Wall Street gang is honest: they just don't cover something that smells egregiously bad. But there is enormous latitude in coverage and in giving out buy and overweight ratings to overvalued stocks: ""Put some lipstick on this pig."" Vermillion.

I already own a fair amount of physical real estate (rental apartments and houses) and I was trying to decide if I should buy more physical real estate, REITs or the wider US stock market (S&amp;P 500).  As part of this exercise I decided to look at the performance of Vanguard's REIT index fund (VGSLX) versus the SPX.  I started on 11/12/01 because that was the first trading day for VGSLX.

Interestingly - and somewhat counterintuitively - VGSLX outperformed SPX over the period by 111 percentage points cumulatively, including reinvested dividends (530% for VGSLX vs 419% for SPX).  VGSLX's annualized standard deviation averaged \~15% over the period vs SPX's standard deviation of \~21%.  So, over this particular 21.5 year period, REITs delivered higher returns and lower volatility than the S&amp;P.  These are pre-tax numbers, of course.  The beginning yield on VGSLX was 5.6% vs the SPX's yield of 1.7%.  That 3.9% beginning dividend yield differential engendered all of the outperformance.  As a result of the higher tax rate on dividends, taxable accounts would've have seen a much narrower spread in performance between VGSLX and SPX.  In non-taxable accounts all of the performance spread would have been captured.  

There's no recommendation here and, of course, ""past performance is not a guarantee of future results.""  But it is a bit unusual to see a single asset class outperform the wider market (1) over a long period of time, AND (2) with meaningfully lower volatility.   

When one can combine a dozen REITs today - and, importantly, avoiding some really risky exposures like office and class B malls, etc - and get to a yield of 7%+ and then pick up a couple of extra points of return through writing covered calls, I do wonder why I should even bother with physical RE (headaches) or the wider stock market (pricey and volatile).  Anyhow, I'm just thinking out loud."|0.71|13|0|13

&gt; 
&gt; **""This part of the crisis is over,""** he told analysts on a Monday conference call.
&gt; 
&gt; In the last eight weeks, three of the biggest 30 US banks failed and hundreds of billions in deposits left small banks as customers scrambled for safety and higher yields.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; It puts Dimon back at the center of a banking crisis for the second time in 15 years. In 2008 JPMorgan purchased investment bank Bear Stearns and then Seattle’s Washington Mutual.
&gt; 
&gt; This period, he told reporters Monday, ""is **nothing like 2008, 2009** for a lot of different reasons.""

&gt; Regulators seized First Republic (FRC) early on Monday and sold most of the bank's operations to JPMorgan in the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that the seizure of First Republic puts to rest panic for the banking system.
&gt; 
&gt; **""This part of the crisis is over,""** he told analysts on a Monday conference call.
&gt; 
&gt; A number of banks, including JPMorgan and PNC, had submitted bids on Sunday to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to acquire the embattled bank.

&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **Shares JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) rose 3%** Monday morning.
&gt; 
&gt; In other news, interest rates will be in the spotlight this week as the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee meeting kicks off on May 2. Markets put chances of a quarter-point hike at 86% as of Monday morning.
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, data releases on construction spending, factory orders, jobless claims are on deck this week, and the big headliner at the end of the week will be the April jobs report. All the economic data is expected to lead to another volatile week for the Treasury yields.

The second article here goes into factors that should determine investment decisions this week, but didn't mention how investors will view the regional banks. Though at the beginning it did acknowledge that investors were ""digesting"" the move by J.P. Morgan to acquire First Republic.

&gt;PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp each slumped more than 25% Tuesday, leading a renewed selloff in regional lenders as investors continued to gauge the health of the industry after the second-largest US bank failure ever.

&gt;Trading in shares of both banks were halted for volatility, amid the broader slide that took the KBW Regional Banking Index down as much as 6.1%, the most intraday since March 17. Comerica Inc. and Zions Bancorp. each fell more than 10%, while Charles Schwab Corp., the brokerage with a bank arm that’s come under pressure in the wake of the regional banking tumult, sank 5.3%. 

&gt;The sector’s retreat comes a day after First Republic Bank’s seizure and sale to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and underscores investors’ ongoing concerns about competitors of the four banks that have collapsed since early March. The slide has now taken the regional banking gauge down 28% this year.

&gt;JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was quick to proclaim the current leg of the banking crisis “over” during a conference call discussing his bank’s acquisition of First Republic on Monday. He recommended everyone “just take a deep breath” even as higher interest rates and stress on the commercial real estate industry pose a threat to the banking sector.

&gt;“While FRC resolution is a good sign, we haven’t had a clear solution to the lack of confidence across regional banks and may need a more holistic response from regulators or the government,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Herman Chan said in a message.

&gt;Western Alliance and PacWest are among a number of regional banks investors zeroed in after Silvergate Capital Corp., SVB Financial Group and Signature Bank collapsed in quick succession and demonstrated the threat posed to commercial lenders by asset-liability mismatches and uninsured deposits.

&gt;But both companies posted earnings results in April that appeared to appease investors, with both firms indicating their deposit bases had stabilized or recovered after initial outflows in March.

&gt;“It looks like JPMorgan’s deal for FRC gave us one day of calm for the banking sector. Regional banking stocks are still looking vulnerable until we see clear signs that emergency lending programs can go away,” said Ed Moya, Oanda senior market analyst. “Wall Street is wondering which bank could be the next one that needs a rescue and that is making it easy to pick on the other regional banks.”"|0.78|23|0|23

**(NASDAQ:IEP)**

* Icahn Enterprises (IEP) is an \~$18 billion market cap holding company run by corporate raider and activist investor Carl Icahn, who, along with his son Brett, own approximately 85% of the company.
* Our research has found that IEP units are inflated by 75%+ due to 3 key reasons: (1) IEP trades at a 218% premium to its last reported net asset value (NAV), vastly higher than all comparables (2) we've uncovered clear evidence of inflated valuation marks for IEP's less liquid and private assets (3) the company has suffered additional performance losses year to date following its last disclosure.
* Most closed-end holding companies trade around or at a discount to their NAVs. For comparison, vehicles run by other star managers, like Dan Loeb’s Third Point and Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square, trade at *discounts*of 14% and 35% to NAV, respectively.
* We further compared IEP to all 526 U.S.-based closed end funds (CEFs) in Bloomberg’s database. Icahn Enterprises’ premium to NAV was higher than all of them and more than double the next highest we found.
* A reason for IEP’s extreme premium to NAV, based on a review of retail investor-oriented media, is that average investors are attracted to (a) IEP’s large dividend yield and (b) the prospect of investing alongside Wall Street legend Carl Icahn. Institutional investors have virtually no ownership in IEP.
* Icahn Enterprises’ current dividend yield is \~15.8%, making it the highest dividend yield of any U.S. large cap company by far, with the next closest at \~9.9%.
* As a result of the company’s elevated unit price, its current annual dividend rate equates to an absurd 50.5% of indicative net asset value.
* The company’s outlier dividend is made possible (for now) because Carl Icahn owns roughly 85% of IEP and has been largely taking dividends in units (instead of cash), reducing the overall cash outlay required to meet the dividend payment for remaining unitholders.
* The dividend is entirely *unsupported* by IEP’s cash flow and investment performance, which has been negative for years. IEP’s investment portfolio has lost \~53% since 2014. The company’s free cash flow figures show IEP has cumulatively burned \~$4.9 billion over the same period.
* Despite its negative financial performance, IEP has raised its dividend 3 times since 2014. IEP’s most recent dividend increase came in 2019, when it raised quarterly distributions from $1.75 to $2.00 per unit. IEP’s free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion in the same year.
* Given that the investment and operating performance of IEP has burned billions in capital, the company has been forced to support its dividend using regular open market sales of IEP units through at-the-market (ATM) offerings, totaling $1.7 billion since 2019.
* In brief, Icahn has been using money taken in from new investors to pay out dividends to old investors. Such ponzi-like economic structures are sustainable only to the extent that new money is willing to risk being the last one “holding the bag”.
* Supporting this structure is Jefferies, the only large investment bank with research coverage on IEP. It has continuously placed a “buy” rating on IEP units. In one of the worst cases of sell-side research malpractice we’ve seen, Jefferies’ research assumes in all cases, *even in its bear case*, that IEP’s dividend will be safe “into perpetuity”, despite providing no support for that assumption.
* Since 2019, one bank has run all of IEP’s $1.7 billion in ATM offerings: Jefferies. In essence, Jefferies is luring in retail investors through its research arm under the guise of IEP’s ‘safe’ dividend, while *also* selling billions in IEP units through its investment banking arm to support the very same dividend.
* Adding to evidence of IEP’s unsustainability, we estimate that IEP’s last reported indicative year-end NAV of $5.6 billion is inflated by at least 22%, due to a combination of overly aggressive marks on IEP’s less liquid/private investments and continued year to date underperformance.
* In one example, IEP owns 90% of a publicly traded meat packaging business that it valued at $243 million at year-end. The company had a market value of only $89 million at the time. In other words, IEP marked the value of its public company equity holdings 204% above the prevailing public market price.
* The mark is even more irregular given that IEP bought over a million shares of the company in December before immediately writing up the value of those shares by \~194% in the same month.
* In another instance, IEP marked its “Automotive Parts” division at $381 million in December 2022. Its key subsidiary declared bankruptcy a month later.
* IEP reported $455 million in “real estate holdings” in its most recent quarter. The reported values in this segment have been remarkably stable for years despite declining net income and despite including (i) the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, which was razed to the ground in 2021; (ii) a country club that became nearly insolvent in 2020 before ownership reverted to its members in 2021; and (iii) a lack of transparency on other assets and valuations.
* The irregular valuation marks fit a pattern: In January of 2020, UBS dropped coverage of IEP citing a “lack of transparency” following its research showing marks that were “divergent from their public market values”, among other issues.
* Beyond aggressive marks, Icahn’s liquid portfolio has continued to generate losses. Our analysis of Icahn’s latest December 2022 13-F filing indicates that IEP’s long holdings have lost \~$471 million in value year to date, despite the S&amp;P gaining \~9.2% in the same time frame.
* IEP disclosed that its investment fund had a 47% notional short bet in its December 2022 filings. Given the positive market performance, we estimate this short bet has contributed at least a further $272 million in year-to-date losses.
* Overall, we estimate IEP’s current NAV as being closer to $4.4 billion, or 22% lower than its disclosed year-end indicative NAV of $5.6 billion. The analysis suggests that units currently trade at a 310% premium to NAV, with an annual dividend rate of 64% of NAV.
* Tightening matters further, IEP is highly levered, with $5.3 billion in Holdco debt and maturities of $1.1 billion, $1.36 billion, and $1.35 billion due in 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively.
* IEP’s debt covenants limit the company’s financial flexibility: IEP is not permitted to incur additional indebtedness and is only allowed to refinance old debt. With interest rates having increased, IEP will need to pay significantly higher interest expenses on future refinancings.
* Carl Icahn’s ownership in IEP comprises about 85% of his overall net worth, according to Forbes, giving him limited room to maneuver with his own outside capital. We have assessed that Icahn has little ability or reason to bail out IEP with a capital injection, particularly at such elevated unit prices.
* Further underscoring Icahn’s limited financial flexibility, he has pledged 181.4 million units, \~60% of his IEP holdings, for personal margin loans. Margin loans are a risky form of debt often reliant on high share (or unit) prices.
* Icahn has not disclosed basic metrics around his margin loans like loan to value (LTV), maintenance thresholds, principal amount, or interest rates. We think unitholders deserve this information in order to understand the risk of margin calls should IEP unit prices revert toward NAV, a reality we see as inevitable.
* Given limited financial flexibility and worsening liquidity, we expect Icahn Enterprises will eventually cut or eliminate its dividend entirely, barring a miracle turnaround in investment performance.
* Overall, we think Icahn, a legend of Wall Street, has made a classic mistake of taking on too much leverage in the face of sustained losses: a combination that rarely ends well."|0.91|440|0|440

t3_135cdau|1683005821|investing|JP Morgan Acquires First Republic Bank: A Home Run Wrapped in Modesty|"Hey r/investing! I recently read an article about JP Morgan's acquisition of First Republic Bank and thought I'd share my thoughts on the matter.

According to the article, JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon and CFO Jeremy Barnum emphasized that the deal was not a fantastic one for their company, but rather a ""modest"" one that they took on out of a sense of duty. However, it seems like JP Morgan might be downplaying the actual benefits of this acquisition.

Here's a quick rundown of the deal:

* JP Morgan acquired $185.8 billion in assets from First Republic, including $29.6bn in securities, $150.3bn in loans, and $5.9bn of other items.
* In return, they assumed $172.8 billion in liabilities, consisting of $92.5bn in deposits, $28bn in Federal Home Loan Bank debt, $50bn in FDIC funding, and $2bn of other items.
* JP Morgan also made a cash payment of $10.6 billion to the FDIC.

This puts the ""modest"" accounting gain at a few billion dollars, which doesn't seem too shabby. But what's more interesting is the earnings power that this acquisition brings to JP Morgan.

The acquired loan book, which now holds loans at a discount to face value, provides a decent yield. Additionally, the FDIC takes on 80% of the losses in case of defaults, which reduces the amount of capital JP Morgan has to hold against the loans, ultimately increasing its profit margin.

Another intriguing aspect of the deal is the $50 billion in five-year fixed-rate funding from the FDIC. This helps lock in a good spread on the loans through 2028, and the structure of the loans ensures a profit for JP Morgan in the years following.

Although JP Morgan claims the deal will add around $500 million in net income annually, it seems they're being conservative with their estimates, as First Republic generated net earnings at an annualized rate of over $1 billion in its last reported quarter.

Overall, it appears that this acquisition is indeed a home run for JP Morgan, despite their insistence on its modesty. The FDIC may have taken a $13 billion hit on the deal, but with limited bidders capable of handling First Republic's balance sheet, it's clear that JP Morgan was in a strong position to take advantage.

As for the broader market, this deal raises questions about the potential stagnation of margins. If margins were to flatline, investors might have to accept less earnings growth than they've become accustomed to over the long bull market. This could be an important factor for investors to consider moving forward.

The details that I can find from this deal seem to be that JPM pays $10.6 billion in cash to the FDIC. For that it gets

Liabilities: $90 billion deposits, of which it will repay asap $30 billion (including $5 billion to itself) of the big banks' attempted rescue deposits, presumably using the bulk of $50 billion in financing provided by the FDIC at an undisclosed (i.e. not very high) interest rate.

Assets: $170 billion in loans and $30 billion (par value) in securities. So the bonds make up about 15% of the assets

So JPM is basically paying $100 billion (plus some amount of interest on the $50B of financing) for $200 billion in nominal assets, 85% of which is loans, 15% of which is securities. Seems reasonable to say then that JPM is essentially paying $85 billion for the loans and $15 billion for the securities.

Obviously the securities have a market value way below par. Somewhere around 60%-70% of par at the moment. 60% of $30 billion is $18 billion. So JPM is paying $15 billion for $18+ billion worth of securities. Can this really be called a loss? Obviously interest rates could continue to move higher and the market value of the bonds could continue to fall, but this seems like JPM is getting a lot of value.

Is it interesting to buy with the actual prices since that maybe in one or two decades the prices could be divided 10 times or more ?

- Robotics can make paying building workers so much cheaper which will affect the final seelig price.
- Nanothecs or 3D printing can literally makes building workers useless even robots.
- An AI which can pilot this 3D printer can easily do the full job of building.

This comes after recently discussing the risks associated with this sector.

What else can we expect?

🔺 US commercial property prices are falling amid rising interest rates. This has particularly affected office buildings: not everyone has returned to the office after COVID, and the vacancy rate in rented spaces hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels.

🔺 Prices for some properties have dropped by 25-30% or more. Recent data shows that commercial real estate in Californian cities such as Santa Ana and San Francisco is up for sale at discounted prices compared to just three years ago—30-60% off, depending on the age of the buildings.

🔺 The main issue is that most commercial real estate has been purchased on credit. In the next two years, according to some estimates, around $1 trillion in mortgage loans will require refinancing.

There are serious concerns that banks will be very reluctant or even unable to refinance troubled borrowers.

Why? **First, banks have their own full plate of problems.**

🔹 US commercial banks hold $4.2 trillion in Treasury bonds and other government securities. For large banks, these assets make up nearly 24% of their portfolios on average, while for smaller banks, it's 15%.

🔹 Additionally, banks hold a significant portion of their assets in commercial bonds. This is largely to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements.

🔹 The decline in the market value of these assets due to raised interest rates has seriously reduced banks' ability to return funds in the event of a run on deposits.

🔹 Small and regional banks were the largest source of credit for the industry last year. Following the recent bankruptcies of SVB and Signature, depositors withdrew some of their funds, and these banks will be less willing to provide financing.

❗️ Now, the most important part – providing credit for office real estate, for example, is extremely risky today. The collateral consists of the very square footage that is dropping in price. Moreover, in some cases, the value of the collateral is already significantly lower than the volume of loans issued against it.

If, or more accurately, when some borrowers fail to meet their obligations, banks may start going bankrupt. **This wave of bankruptcies appears INEVITABLE**. Similarly, as will be the case for developers.

The FDIC won't have enough money to save all banks, and in the worst-case scenario, they will focus on systemically important ones.

Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) that won't receive payments will plummet. This, in turn, will spread panic among CMBS holders and increase the likelihood of bankruptcies for issuing banks. Of the aforementioned $1 trillion needing refinancing, \~30% is backed by CMBS.

The stock market will slump, and spreads will rise to levels exceeding those during the COVID era.

Do you think everything described here is just a theoretical picture? Let's talk about it in a year.

Nevertheless, I believe that a major systemic crisis comparable to 2008 will likely be avoided. There is both experience and a difference in scale. However, the recession that is currently only being threatened is inevitable and will drag on for a long time. And the real estate sector could very well be one of the most problematic in this situation.

It's hard to predict what the Federal Reserve will do in such a situation. Interest rates may need to be lowered, but any compromise between growth, unemployment, and inflation will be less favorable than the situation during the COVID era.

Global markets will also feel the impact.

✔️ Initially, due to a slowdown in lending rates and a general reduction in the money supply,

✔️ Later, when the recession starts to gain momentum and energy resource prices fall, the impact may intensify.

*And you ask – why do I see a very real possibility of the S&amp;P dropping to the 3200 level? There is a chance. The question is only a matter of timing. Although it is unlikely to happen quickly and all at once.*"|0.79|50|0|50

Social media platforms like Facebook and Meta can now offer targeted advertising that rivals Google's ad space.

This realization has made me reconsider my stance on Facebook as a long-term investment. If they can continue to dominate the social media space and leverage their user data to create highly effective ad campaigns, they could be a much better long-term investment than I previously thought. Meanwhile, Alphabet may struggle as their monopoly in information gatekeeping is no longer a sure thing."|0.31|0|0|0

I could really use your insight on a potential investment opportunity. I'm from North Macedonia and have a budget of around €150,000-€160,000 to invest. I've been considering purchasing an apartment in Thessaloniki, Greece, to rent out throughout the year. The average rent in the area ranges from €500-€700 per month, and the property market seems to be on the rise as time passes, which could lead to an increase in apartment values over time.

Aside from the potential returns on my investment, I'd like to provide my parents with €200 from the rental income each month to help improve their quality of life. Moreover, the close proximity of Thessaloniki to North Macedonia would make it easier for me to manage the property if necessary.

However, I'm concerned about the potential impacts of climate change on Greece and whether it could affect the value of this investment in the long run. Additionally, I'd appreciate any thoughts you have on investing in rental properties in general and whether you think this is a smart move or maybe propose some other options in other areas.

We will buy the new house cash, so no financing issues. Here is the issue: we need to park a good amount of money (way over the $250k) for about 4-6 weeks and I am worried about keeping it all on a regular bank account because of Silicon Valley bank, etc. 

In the past I did CDARS where my bank would distribute the money over several different banks in tranches of $250k each and therefore it would all be FDIC insured. However this process isn’t practical for a month or so since it takes about a week for it to be deposited and the shortest time period is about one month. 

So I currently have two ideas:

1. open an account with Chase (too big to fail) and just keep the cash there
Or 
2. Put it into my Schwab or Interactive Brokers account and buy a super short term fund or something like that with a AAA risk. 

Does anyone know any good money market type funds that are super short ans therefore have very limited interest rate risk? 

Or any other ideas?

Looking at energy stocks, we can see the solar and wind sectors facing a (temporary?) downturn; on the other side, OPEC efforts to keep WTI and Brent in the $80 range with their announced cuts are failing due to Russia smuggling oil to just about everywhere at discount price.

t3_1313zp8|1682624743|investing|Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is Trading 140ish Now But the Fad Stock of 2020 is Still Being Chased by Retail Investors. You Cannot Outrun a Falling Star|" Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) became a fad stock when it more than doubled its IPO offer price of $120 and closed at $245 in September 2020. Then, in mid-November 2021, SNOW rose to $390 -- that was an increase of 225% from the IPO offer price and made many investors giddy. One such investor was Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), which bought SNOW at the offer price and still holds $900 million worth of SNOW shares: as many realize, however, this is a tiny, tiny stake for BH and amounts to just 0.3% of the portfolio. It is believed that one of Buffett’s lieutenants, Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, may be behind the selection and not Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger. The stock now trades 140ish, down 44% from the IPO closing price; those who bought in Nov. 2021 at $402 are down 65%. Only those who got in at the IPO offer price of $120, like BRK, are still in the money. Still, the company has a market cap of $44 billion and is considered among leaders in the crowded, cloud-based software space.

***Share-based Compensation is Out of Control***

SNOW commands very high valuation metrics. The company is not EBITDA-positive yet but expects to be for the fiscal year ending (FYE) January 31, 2025 (FY2). Now, it's trading at 184x FY2 EBITDA. It has been free cash flow (FCF)-positive the last 2 years but that is after adding back stock-based compensation (SBC), which amounted to $605mm in 2021and $862mm in 2022.

Without the add-back, FCF is negative. FCF is usually calculated from net income by adding back SBC just like you're adding back non-cash charges like depreciation and amortization. That's how you erase the impact of SBC from FCF, which is the equity level (i.e., levered) FCF, unlike enterprise-level earnings measures like EBITDA and EBIT that are calculated on an unadjusted basis. However, even though SBC has no impact on actual cash flow, it will bite your share price when these shares vest and dilution hits.

SNOW is just out of control with its SBC, doling out insane amounts of shares to management and employees. In 2022, the total SBC accounted for nearly half (47.4%) of net sales and 29.1% of its total costs (that is, cost of sales plus operating expenses). By contrast, among SNOW’s peers, the typical SBC accounts for 22-26% of net sales and 20-22% of total costs. Snowflake is certainly an outlier in this regard.

What jumps out from this table is the disparity in “% of Net Sales” (47.4%) vs. “% of Total Costs” (29.1%). This figure for SNOW is striking at 47.4% vs. 29.1%: the 18.3% disparity contrasts with the comparable companies that are much closer together. What this shows is the magnitude of the loss that SNOW is reporting and the resultant lack of cost discipline in awarding such large amounts of SBC to employees. SNOW is one of the largest cloud-based companies when measured in terms of equity market cap ($45 billion) and total revenues ($2.1 billion). Yet it is doling out nearly half of its total revenues to SBC for employees. SNOW’s cost structure still resembles an early-stage company funded via venture capital reporting very little revenues and burning through cash reserves in an out of control manner.

The company expects a small base of EBITDA in 2024 (FY2); therefore, any earnings metrics below EBITDA will be negative. Currently, SNOW trades at 22x its $2.1b in LTM net sales and 16x its expected FY1 net sales of $2.9b. These are among the highest revenue multiples even for a cloud-based software company. However, revenue growth is estimated at 35-40% year over year in FY1 (2023) and FY2 (2024).

Looking at the financials, SNOW has some impressive growth metrics: the aforementioned sales growth rate is impressive and it enjoys working capital benefits from having customers prepay for services with its software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. There is very little capex and just a small amount of capitalized software; thus, depreciation and amortization are not material cash flow items.

***The Problem with SNOW’s Gross Margin and Scalability***

The issue, once again, is cost control, particularly SBC and the resulting dilution risk, and the growing concern about profitability and margins. While cloud-based software companies often enjoy 75%+ gross margins, SNOW is at 65%. To understand this, you need to look at the components of SNOW’s gross margin: aside from product sales which has a standalone gross margin of 65-72%, SNOW has a money-losing segment called “professional services and other” with a negative gross margin. Both margins are on an improving trend; however, when total revenues more than doubled as it did in FYE 2022, the gross margin for professional services worsened and only lessened losses a bit in the most recent fiscal year to -34%.

This is a labor-intensive business which helps customers migrate from legacy applications to SNOW’s platform. SNOW considers this type of customer care to be essential for customer retention. Indeed, even though this segment contributes to only 6.1-6.5% of net sales, it accounts for the majority of the revenue-generating employees at SNOW. These employees account for 55-59% of total such employees and the headcount for this business is 30% higher than those in the product segment.

The problem is that this particular segment does not seem to be very scalable: from 2021 to 2023, it has remained fairly stable at 6.1-6.5% of total revenues. In other words, while total net sales increased 249% from $554 million to $1.9 billion, the professional services segment still accounted for 6.1% of total revenues. Scalability seems to be somewhat limited for SNOW’s revenue-generating business model. While the overall gross margin could rise over time, it is questionable if it would ever rise to the level of its peers at 75%. Indeed, SNOW identifies the cost of this professional services segment as a significant risk factor in its 10-K:

*“If we are unable to successfully manage the growth of our professional services business and improve our profit margin from these services, our operating results … including our profit margins, will be harmed.”*

If the gross margin cannot go over 70% near-term, it could hinder SNOW from attaining sufficient profitability to grow its FCF meaningfully. In other words, SNOW’s growth strategy and the customer migration business model will hit the wall sooner or later without a meaningful increase in profitability.

***So How Much is SNOW Worth?***

Based on analyst projections and applying reasonable margins, SNOW could do about $700mm in unlevered FCF (sans SBC add back) in 2024. From this FCF base, we can estimate SNOW's FCF growing by 40% annually for the next 5 years using its discount rate of \~12-13%. The result is $80 in fair value for the stock; that's 43% below the 140ish stock price of recent days. This may seem harsh since the stock never traded that low in history (the lowest intraday recorded was $110.26 on June 14, 2022).

Well, those concerns were outlined above. If you consider other cloud-based software companies, the best positioned is Crowdstrike (CRWD), which has similar market cap, financials, growth rates and even stock price as SNOW: CRWD trades 130ish. I find its fair value to be \~$100, a discount of only \~20% from where it trades. CRWD has much better margins, has been growing quicker and is not hampered by SNOW’s the out-of-control and unwieldy cost structure: its gross margin averaged 74% the last 3 years and with the operating leverage accruing to its operating income and bottom line, the company seems to be ready to harvest meaningful inflow of FCF. Indeed, with a more disciplined cost structure, CRWD has been FCF-positive (without the SBC add back) since 2020. Financially, this is simply a much better-managed company than the fad stock of 2020 basking in its afterglow.

t3_130w8fs|1682614600|investing|Opinions on Bond Market Funds|"In theory, the final bond rate rise is coming in May, with the rates to then be held there until inflation is either down to 2% or something breaks, whichever is first. With that in mind, I'm considering getting big into bond funds, and want to see what people think about the overall premise. With the yield curve being inverted as it is, I would target 5-10 year bond funds, as their rates would be the most likely to change if the yield curve uninverted. 

It seems that the following scenarios are possible:

1) rates are raised in May and held there for some time. As long as you get into bond funds at after the last rate raise, it is likely that they would continue to hold their value and provide their dividends. Equities would likely suffer or stagnate during that time due to the high interest rates, making bond funds a compelling risk-adjusted choice.

2) rates are raised in May and then dropped shortly after due to recession or banking breakage. In this scenario, bond funds purchased before the rate drop would appreciate significantly in value, while equities would likely suffer. You would be able to dump the bond funds after the risk free rate dips below 1% for significant profit and return that into equities to catch the upswing. 

3) rates are raised in May and then dropped shortly after due to recession, but for some reason that causes equities to rocket ship up. Seems like it shouldn't happen, but given what's happened in recent years it's very possible. Bond funds go up, equities go up meaning you lose on overall gain, but still come out ahead. 

4) rates continue to rise after May. Bond funds and equities suffer due to high interest rates. Bonds will either underperform equities if companies continue to post robust profits, or overperform if inflation begins to cut into their margins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I'm missing, or do medium-term bonds appear to be the superior option in pretty much every scenario in the current investing environment?"|0.86|5|0|5

Over the last year or so it’s been a little disheartening to see that I contributed over $6k but the total in the account has only gone up about $1k (it’s all in funds that track with medium and large cap US stocks… RIP 💀). Anyway, it got me thinking about whether I would benefit more from just trying to pay off my house sooner. I bought in 2018 for $620k, and refinanced during COVID to 2.25% without affecting the maturity date. Current balance on the loan is ~$550k. 

Using a simple online IRA calculator, with annual contributions of $6k, average return of 5%, and retirement age of 65, it’s estimating about $1M in the account by that time. If I were to forego future contributions and instead put that $6k per year into paying off my mortgage, will it yield a better return in the long run? It sucks to see that over half of my monthly loan payment is going towards interest and escrow, so it really makes me want to focus on paying that down.

t3_130epdn|1682585731|investing|My framework for stock analysis|" 

1. Understand the company and how it generates revenues. Which are the company's most attractive business units with the highest margins? Does the company have a competitive advantage relative to their competitors? E.g. can they manufacture goods more cheaply or with better quality?
2. Understand the competitive landscape and the industry's barriers to entry. How many competitors does the company compete with and is this increasing or decreasing over time? Is it easy for a new entrant to start competing in the industry?
3. Look at the track record of management, are there any dubious or shady figures involved? Have they successfully managed businesses in the past?
4. Scrutinize the balance sheet, make sure the company isn't over-leveraged. You can look at 'net debt / ebitda' here. If it is a high-growth company which is loss-making, how many years can the company continue to burn cash in this fashion? - You can look at the net cash position here and then compare with how negative the FCF is in a typical year. If it is a company with order flow, look at how many years or months of revenues does the backlog cover.
5. Valuation: for mature businesses, you can look at the next-twelve-month's PE - is this in line with its historical average or does it look stretched / depressed? For high-growth businesses, you can look at next-twelve-month's EV/ Sales or EV/ EBITDA, however, make sure you don't overpay. Try to work out what the margins of the business will be once growth matures. Then work out what the normalized PE or EBITDA 5 years into the future for example to determine whether the shares are attractively valued.

Net income companywide fell 24% to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $7.47 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Meta said that total expenses for 2023 will be in the range of $86 billion to $90 billion. That figure includes restructuring costs that range between $3 billion to $5 billion.

Capital expenditures will remain in the range of $30 billion to 33 billion. That figure accounts for its increased artificial intelligence investments and its ad-supported products like the newsfeed and Reels, the company said.

The after-market rally further boosted a stock that's been on an upward trend since Zuckerberg announced in February that 2023 would be the company's ""year of efficiency.""

The shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, but were up 74% this year, prior to the earnings report. Including the post-report surge on Wednesday to over $234, the shares are up about 164% from their November 2022 low of around $89.

Investors have rallied around Zuckerberg's plans to slim down his company through a series of layoffs, resulting in some 21,000 expected job cuts. The revenue base had been shrinking from a battered online advertising market and the lingering effects of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update that dramatically limited ad-targeting capabilities."|0.92|618|0|618

If you are in a higher tax bracket and especially if you pay NIIT on top of your marginal rate, now is the time to switch from VUSXX/VMFXX or even from FRNs like USFR. At least temporarily. 

VMSXX is cyclical and follows a sinus wave that is simple to anticipate as it has followed the same pattern for a long long time.

As a new invested in my mid 50s I made the mistake of using some of the portfolio methods for an IRA when I chose mutual funds, ETFs and bonds in my taxable account.

I'll be using this as my biggest bucket for retirement in about 15 years.  
I was looking for an alternative to bonds for this account to save on taxes but still have growth.  Both VTMFX and AOA have been mentioned to me as ones to consider.  VTMFX is a MF with about 50% bonds included, AOA is an ETF with about 20% bonds included.  I currently have short treasury bills in this account.  Any thoughts on a choice between VTMFX or AOA for this spot in my taxable account?

They completed the migration recently and liquidated all of our positions for us to reallocate our funds.  After looking at the options I was baffled at the funds that were offered to us.  

The best ones are a fidelity S&amp;P 500 fund with a 1.02 expense ratio, a russel 1000 growth, 2000 and 3000 index with a 1.51 expense ratio and  various target date funds with a 1.43 expense ratio. 

There were other funds such as reit funds, value funds, bond funds and an automated 60/40 stock bond fund. I have no interest in these because I have over 20 years of work ahead of me and I want to keep an aggressive 401k. 



Would it be worth the extra expense in  fees to go in on the russel 1000 index for higher growth vs going a slower pace at the fidelity s&amp;p 500 fund?  



This drives me crazy on why they would switch providers as this is clearly hurting the employees."|0.62|4|0|4

t3_12y6xb7|1682393805|investing|Wanting to get rid of PMI and I have a few options|"Hi! I’m 26 yrs old living in South East Texas. I make $53560/yr. I max out my Roth IRA and my job puts away for retirement, as well. I have a nest egg that is roughly 4 months of living expenses. I also have a brokerage account with around $7000 in it, this is invested in primarily the S&amp;P500, AAPL, and a clean energy fund with smaller holdings in a sports gambling ETF and a space technology ETF

I currently own a home that I bought with a state grant. I used that grant to put down ~7% on a 200,000 home and have a 30 yr note with about a $1400 payment currently (that’s principal, interest, taxes, and insurance). My girlfriend of 6 yrs and I split this payment and all other expenses 50/50

My current goal is to get rid of my PMI. My current trajectory is no more PMI in May 2030. My PMI is $101 a month.

I have 3 things to consider to help me do that faster. 

I am getting a 4% raise. I am considering taking that money (roughly $70/pay check or ~$2000/yr) and putting it towards the house. This would put me ahead by 24 months of payments. This would save me 2424 in the log run, not to mention the interest I’d save.

I have $7000 invested with no goal for it. I could pull that and put it towards the house. This would put me 22 months ahead of schedule, and I could invest the new money and rebuild just the same. Which would save me 2222 including the interest difference.

Finally, I could do both. Doing both would put me 40 months ahead of schedule. Which would save me 4,040, plus all the interest.

Is it worth doing this? Or should I just invest the $70/paycheck and let that continue to move?

Bonus question, what do you use your brokerage investments for? I’ve never really had a goal for mine and the last time I sold was to pay off my car in late 2020.

What does the bid yield actually tell you, if not the expected return you’d make?

In a more general view of bonds, is it the current bid yield which determines the annual returns, assuming you hold till maturity?

t3_12vjq1c|1682198400|investing|Inmates Running the Asylum: Low Quality Articles on Investing and Stock Picking by Journos Pretending to be Investment Analysts|"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-103034245.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-103034245.html)

We know that journos are not financial analysts nor should they pretend to be. But they continue to do so with impunity. There are so many low-quality articles being written on investing and stock-picking that sometimes you feel compelled to refute them.

The above-linked article in InvestorPlace was carried by YahooFinance and came to my attention. It's a short piece on Buffett's stock picks written by a journo masquerading as some kind of stock picker. Once you examine the article and the places he's worked at, it's immediately obvious that this is a liberal arts major with no financial training who is clueless about financial statements and market data.

The article starts out by opining that Buffett bought many cyclical stocks in 2022. Then he opines that investors should ""emulate the Oracle of Omaha and snap up"" 3 Buffett stocks which may outperform the market. The stocks he has in mind are (1) Bank of America (BAC), (2) American Express (Amex), and (3) Louisiana Pacific (LPX). Let's just examine BAC since it will take too much effort to refute all three and waste time on this imbecile.

Regarding BAC, the journo notes it's trading at $27.90 (at the time) which is ""unjustified"" as BAC is a large bank that will ""benefit from deposit inflows because of worries about smaller banks."" BAC is large so will attract deposits from smaller, regional banks. So he observes BAC's earnings will rise from $3.19 in 2022 to analysts' estimate of $3.39 in 2023. Well, here's the problem: first, that's a modest 6.4% EPS growth year over year and that's good. But $3.39 is also the estimate for 2024. In other words, analysts are projecting no earnings growth from 2023 to 2024. Why do you think that's the case? That's because they expect no revenue growth from 2023 to 2024: in fact, they are projecting a revenue decline from $100.93b to $100.89b. In other words, they are projecting a standstill scenario for BAC which is more than likely a modest banking recession taking place near-term. Btw, this isn't some secret that is being guarded by the keepers of Bank America's flame: this can be gleaned from any public site like YahooFinance compiling analyst estimates:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC/analysis?p=BAC)

But you would not know this from the misrepresentation that earnings growth is impressive and that, given this growth, the stock price is ""unjustifiably"" low.

Let's dig deeper into this misleading claim the stock price is ""unjustifiably low."" Since this journo can't do research himself, he quotes other financial sites and claims BAC has dropped below $30 “for the first time since 2020, as Barron's cited.” I don't think he even looked at the graph himself, which should have been part of his due diligence. BAC dipped below $30 in January and February of 2021: that is, the closing prices registered were lower than $30 on at least 3 trading days during that span; intraday-wise, BAC's stock price was below $30 on at least 6 days out of the first 20 trading days in 2021. I know, because I used to watch BAC.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BAC?p=BAC&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

Then, BAC rose to a high of $49.38 in Feb 2022, which may have given impression that BAC was flying high and anything below $30 is abnormal. But this is how cyclical stocks, which banking stocks are, often behave, even a Systemically Important Bank (SIB) such as BAC.

Plus, when the journo claims the price dropping below $30 is so unprecedented, he implies that BAC must have been trading well above $30 for much of the last 5 years. That is not so either. Except for the 15-month period between March 2021 and May 2022, BAC traded in the low 30s. Prior to 2021, the stock was even under $18 and opened and closed below $20 in March and April of 2020 -- that was only 3 years ago. BAC was indeed a low-20 stock for much of 2020. That's what you call cyclicality and happens to even the largest commercial bank in the world.

Notice the guy doesn't cite financials since he can't. So he focuses instead on market data and graphs but even gets that part wrong. Remember when there was a tech wreck in 2000 (not 2020): that's when journos started masquerading as analysts and started touting Internet stocks like CMGI and coined terms like B2B, B2C, ""killer apps"" and ""category killers.""  It's been more than 20 years. But the same thing is happening again. It doesn't matter whether you like or don't like Buffett's stock picks. The same journos are churning out low-quality articles replete with misinformation and are passing themselves off as analysts. The inmates are running the asylum again."|0.94|291|0|291
t3_12vh093|1682192832|investing|Market Cap + Dividend strategy, would this work?|"Hi everyone

**I. Disclaimers:**

1. I'm rather new to this sub and investing in general, and English is not my first language. This thread may be totally nonsensical and I am sorry if it turns out to be. But I hope to receive constructive criticisms because I wish to learn more from you guys.
2. I have a very limited coding background so I couldn't run a backtest on this strategy that I am proposing. I am hoping if you guys could help me verify if this investing strategy would have worked in the past.
3. Before I start, I have tested against SPY, SCHD and QQQ for a period of 2015-2023 on portfolio visualiser and my strategy seems to work. But the test wasn't extensive as I couldn't have a dynamic data to rebalance the % overtime, it would be a bad idea as I found out NVIDIA was not among the top LargeCap but they climbed tremendously over the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

**II. Short hand notations:**

1. I will use basic short forms like **DCA**, for this post it would simply mean I invest **however much I could at the end of each month**, after sorting out other aspects of my finance.
2. Another set of short forms is LC for Large Cap, TLC for Top Largest Cap, **T1LC** is the **Top 1 Largest Cap**, T2LC for the Top 2 Largest Cap, and so on.
3. Suffice **wD** would mean **with Dividend**. T1LCwD would mean the Top 1 Largest Cap company that pays Dividend.
4. Prefix **a** would mean adjusted. I will introduce this concept in **III.A.** right below.

&amp;#x200B;

**III. So here is the strategy:**

**A. Rules and Criteria:** (I am probably using Excel to manually do this, please let me know if there is a better way. I really regret not taking my 3 years of uni Statistics seriously.)

1. I would update the data every month before the event I mentioned in **II.1**
2. I would take the Current Market Cap Total \* (1+DividendYield%) to get Adjusted Current Market Cap Total for each stock.
3. Sum up the Adjusted Current Market Cap Totals.
4. Find out the % weightage of each stock.
5. Resort them if needed. T1LCwD may not be the same as aT1LCwD because of the multiplication factor in 2.

I will explain deeper in part **B** (and even reset the rules because I don't have a large sum of money to buy all of these stocks).

*Note:*

1. *As aT1LCwD may cause confusion, I will sometime use* ***T1*** *instead.*
2. *I choose stocks wD because I noticed that these are relatively more stable than stocks woD, please counter me if it's dangerously wrong.*
3. *Even in bad crises, yeah you know the rest.*

**B. Algorithm:** (This is a crude skeleton of the plan, I will ignore trading fees for the time being)

1. I will buy 1 T1.
2. a. If buying a T2 will exceed the holding % than 1 T1 %, I will buy 1 more T1 and come back to Step 2.  
b. If buying 1 T2 does not set my T2 at a higher holding % than my T1, buy 1 T2 and proceed to Step 3.
3. Iterate the steps for T3 and continue until my deposit depletes.
4. In the next month, check if there is any changes to the % on Excel, and carry on the algorithm.

&amp;#x200B;

**IV. Additional takes:**

1. The math in **III.A.2** can be modified using Machine Learning to optimise the model. Again I really regret not taking my stats course seriously so I can only use wishful thinking here.
2. This idea is completely opposite to the mean-reversion DCA strategy, where you invest monthly in an index, a bit more when the price drops, a bit less when the price increases. This was shared with me by a friend who I deem very smart and quite knowledgeable. But I find happiness in creating new ideas.
3. This is somewhat a self-correcting algorithm, in the case a new company is rising, it would include and increase the position. The companies that fall off will not yet be sold, they may bounce back.
4. I am aware that Fundalmental &gt; Technical and I should spend more time reading up financial reports and news.  I understand that, but I want to focus more time on my other aspects in life as the time goes by.
5. For some reason, when I tested with JNJ and it seems to be not too effective with this Dividend King. I will update on this if I can think of a reason why."|0.29|0|0|0

For example, when researching Schwab's mmf  SNVXX , on SCHWAB'S OWN website they list a ""7-day yield"" of **4.50%**. ([https://www.schwab.com/money-market-funds](https://www.schwab.com/money-market-funds))

But when I look up the same fund on Marketwatch, ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/snvxx](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/snvxx)) they don't list anything about a 7-day yield HOWEVER, they do list other yields, namely:

* YTD **1.28%**
* 5 YEAR **6.18%**
* YIELD **2.37%** *(what even is this? total yield of all time?)*

Can anybody help me to understand how to ""read"" the fact sheets of these various MMFs (SNVXX was just one example)?

Which yield rates should I actually be looking at? 7-day? YTD? Yield? (and can anybody tell me what that means? Yield over what period?)

Why do all of the fund managers themselves only show the 7-day yield, whereas the external sites ( like marketwatch, yahoo finance, etc) show ytd, 5 year, but NOTHING about 7-day?

I'm sure there's a simple explanation, but I""m trying to compare MMFs and getting a bit confused at which rates I should be using as a comparision.

Thank you in advance!

UPDATE: to ADD FURTHER QUESTION: The ""7-day yield"" (for the same fund, SNVXX) on yahoo finance states ""**.03%**"" ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNVXX/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNVXX/))  But the ""7-day yield"" on Schwab's website states  ""**4.50%**"" [https://www.schwab.com/money-market-funds](https://www.schwab.com/money-market-funds). Are they defining ""7-day yield"" differently?

UPDATE 2: Reseraching some more, I think that PERHAPS one confusion stems from the fact that some yields are showing the 'DIVIDEND' yields, whereas some are showing overall yields. (not sure about terminology there). But perhaps the varying definitions of ""yield"" is what is causing some of (my) confusion...."|0.69|4|0|4

If you sold something for a great profit(short term or long term), but know lets say 30% will have to be paid out to uncle sam when filing taxes next year, what are some good strategies to make the most out of it?  Also something to consider, is that you don't know if you will have losses later that will offset the gains, which makes it a bit tricky.

Couple options I was thinking about:

1. Self withhold 30%, Open a separate cash brokerage account, throw it into some treasury securities or a MMF/TFLO/USFR
2. Self withhold 30%, Put it in a hedged equity etf or fund (to mimimize downside risk). If you have a net loss here, just cough up money from somewhere else tax time
3. Throw it in a hysa (prefer not, as its a pain keeping it in a completely different account)
4. Buy some CDs/bonds that expire around tax time

What do you guys do? Just don't want tax time to come, and realize I spent the reserves on gains, and have to deal with paying a large tax bill. Also, is opening a separate investment account just for the sake of keeping money logically separated a good idea (my broker is fidelity, who sends consolidated tax docs anyhow)?

t3_12uum49|1682137852|investing|Novice retail investor: question about an a volatility investing strategy I came up with?|"I don't know if this is a completely original idea. It probably isn't. But I was learning a bit about how volatility indexes work. Specifically, an index like uvxy.

A lot of these volatility indexes reduce in value significantly over the course of time. Sometimes even losing about 90% value over the course of a given year.

I was trying to think about ways that I could take advantage of this and remembered about something called the Martingale betting strategy, which basically involves doubling your bets every time you lose. The idea behind this betting strategy is that you eventually always win, but it requires essentially an infinite pool of money because it's not realistically possible to double your bet multiple times.

Well, this becomes realistically feasible with volatility indexes.

The idea that I had involves purchasing a specific dollar amount's worth of volatility index shares and continuing to purchase that same set amount of money's worth of shares every time the volatility index reduces in value by 50% or more.

For example, buy $1000 worth of shares of uvxy at $10 per share = 100 shares. Then spend $1000 again at $5 per share = 200 shares, and so on and so forth. This essentially would lead to somebody having thousands and thousands of volatility index shares for paying a sort of ""flat fee"" every few months. Even with reverse splitting being a thing that exists, it would still seemingly be beneficial to do this if feasible for you. 

This essentially makes it so that you don't need to have an infinite amount to money to realistically implement the Martingale betting strategy because you can buy double the amount of shares instead of doubling the amount of money that you spend.

Another possibility could be to consider the historical volatility of the index and set the threshold based on the standard deviation of the volatility. For instance, if the historical volatility of the index is 20%, setting the threshold at 2 standard deviations (40%) could potentially capture significant market movements while reducing the risk of false positives.

By setting the threshold based on the standard deviation, you could adjust the threshold to be more or less conservative depending on the current volatility of the index. This means that in times of high volatility, you could set the threshold higher to potentially capture larger gains, while in times of lower volatility, you could set the threshold lower to potentially avoid unnecessary losses.  

The reasoning behind this is that if the stock's volatility exceeds this threshold, it is likely experiencing a significant deviation from its normal behavior, and it may be a good time to buy in at a lower price. By setting the threshold based on standard deviation, you can adjust for changes in volatility over time and potentially increase your chances of buying low and selling high.

Essentially, this means that if the market ever crashes, you will make a significant amount of money.

So far, I am only able to see two downsides to this:

1) you continue to bleed money in the long run until the stock market crashes which is the only time you would ever make money.

2) said strategy relies on the assumption that the stock Market will crash, which we all know will inevitably be true, but such a mindset is unhealthy for capitalism and the overall economy.


One potential benefit I see if this type of strategy catches on though is that, if retail investors utilize this strategy en masse, it would theoretically scare large whales and billionaire investors in the market  into stopping the stock market from crashing periodically every few years for fear of losing their investments. Ironically, this seems like it would result in more market stability as more retail investors catch on and use this type of strategy. 

My questions to you all are: 

1) am I insane? Or does something like this actually make sense? 

2) what are other downsides to this? 

I'm genuinely interested in learning more about stuff like this and the logic behind it so any feedback would be much appreciated.

If this strategy doesn't yet exist, I would propose to call it Volatility Vanguarding."|0.67|1|0|1

* Start fully invested, in broad market index ETF with markets currently below all time highs.
* When markets reach specified set point (ie. new ATH +10%) sell specified quantity (ie. liquidate 25% to cash or bonds).
* Continue liquidating additional quantities if new set points are reached (ie. liquidate another 25% every additional 10% gain.)
* When markets fall (ie. 10% drop) purchase back specified quantity (ie. the same quantity that was sold at ATH + 10%.)
* If markets continue to fall, purchase back with any withheld amounts at particular set points until fully reinvested.
* Repeat the process through market cycles.

So I guess to simply this question:

**Scenario A**

* Investment A sold, makes $400,000 - Cost Basis $200,000
* Investment B sold, loss of $200,000 - Cost Basis $400,000

t3_12u8tig|1682092498|investing|Navigating Market Uncertainty: A Bearish Outlook Amid Debt, Inflation, and Geopolitical Tensions|"The prevailing market trend remains steady, reflecting a continuation of the recent pattern: a slight and predictable market weakness. Currencies are almost unchanged. **DXY** is hovering around typical levels, (although there are noticeable attempts to grow, we haven’t seen any dramatic changes). Yesterday, the market tried to decline, but the movement was limited to a half percentage point rollback.

A few words about gold: **Gold** is trading in the range of $1980-$2005. Personally, I still believe it's too early to sell or buy in the current market situation. If positions are open, the most reasonable approach would be to wait. Why? I think it would make sense to sell gold either from levels in the $2200-2300 range or from $1975 and below. Lately, we've seen three runs to the highs, followed by an inevitable rollback. Next time, gold might face stronger resistance and decline sharply. However, if we see a breakdown of these levels, we may witness the closing of short positions and potentially a significant short squeeze. I think there's a 50% chance here. Thus, there's no need to rush. If you've been in gold for a while, you've likely made good money already, and now you just need to wait for the right moment to exit positions. However, **if gold falls below $1975, it'll be necessary to close positions and lock in profits.**

What do we think about **UST**? Yields recently jumped to the 3.60-3.62% level. Now they've pulled back a bit, so **TMF** and **TLT** have risen again and will likely continue to rise. We made a small gain, increased our position, and now we're awaiting further developments.

Our strategy is to avoid taking any unnecessary actions. We also have short instruments, which are slightly increasing in price. We won't touch our gold positions. Lastly, we have ten-year UST positions, which provide modest profits. Overall, no drastic changes.

Globally, I view the market from a bearish perspective. I believe we could see movements in the near future driven by several factors:

* Debts that may lead to defaults
* Further growth of interest rates. 

Recent UK statistics showed **that inflation isn't declining**, which means central banks, including the Fed, will continue tightening monetary policy, leading to new problems in the financial sector. So past issues persist.

However, there are additional factors that could be strong triggers for declines. Another round of hassle around the debt ceiling is an important factor that can't be ignored. When senators - Democrats and Republicans - agree to raise the national debt ceiling, **this will lead to a massive increase in borrowing in the markets, which will result in additional liquidity being washed out of the market, plus inherent increased volatility**. I expect it to come within a month.

We also can't exclude the factor of **geopolitical uncertainty**. I believe that problems will emerge globally in the near future - in Europe, along the US-China line over Taiwan, in the Middle East, in Africa, and so on. Although this factor is less important than more direct domestic concerns, it could always rear its ugly head at some unexpected moment."|0.62|10|0|10
t3_12u2fdr|1682085104|investing|Brokered CDs - tax treatment / a loophole?|"I recently discovered Brokered CDs (i.e., CDs that you buy through your brokerage instead of directly from the bank). There's so much more selection, better rates, and it's way easier than opening accounts with different banks! I have some questions about tax treatment, though.

Specifically, I'm looking at 1-year CDs that only pay coupon at maturity. In other words the first coupon payment is in 2024, when the CD matures. (Most other CDs have coupon payments monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually.)

**Question 1:** Since no interest payments are credited in 2023, does that mean that all the interest earned will be taxable in 2024, not in 2023? In a CD with monthly coupon payments, the interest is taxable along the way, ""as earned"". But if the only coupon payment is in April 2024, doesn't that mean it's only taxable in 2024?

**Question 2:** Does that mean this is an effective way to defer interest income into 2024, if I think my tax bracket will be significantly lower in 2024 than in 2023?

**Question 3A:** Since this is a Brokered CD, I can sell it at any time. Let's say I have $10,000 in a 1-year CD maturing on April 1 2024 with 5% interest. On March 31, the CD is 1 day away from receiving a $500 interest coupon. Doesn't that mean that if I sold it on March 31, I would get $10,500 for it? (Assume interest rates have stayed the same so the CD is otherwise trading at par.)

**Question 3B:** If I sold it for $10,500 right before the coupon payment at maturity, doesn't that ""transform"" the $500 from interest income to capital gains income? Which would automatically drop the tax rate?

t3_12twdsd|1682070293|investing|Looking for EU bonds for DIY structured products|"I might be overcomplicating things, but hear me out. I'm EU based and looking to set up a portion of my portfolio as rolling DIY structured products. Idea is to buy EUR denominated bonds with a duration of just below 1Y (so no coupon payments) and take the difference between cost and face value to buy call spreads on single stocks that I have high conviction on with a matching (or slightly longer) expiry date. In theory, as long as I let the bonds mature, I would collect the initial investment plus the leftover amount (discount on face value) I used for call spread premiums. I get full downside protection and (capped) upside participation. I'd want to avoid FX fluctuations on the fixed income side, so the bonds would have to be EUR denominated. On the option side I'm flexible with regard to currency and it's most likely going to be denominated in USD, both due to individual stock choice and lower premium spreads. Having a rolling maturity date of around 1Y also allows me to stop reinvesting if I'll need the money. 


So ideally for lots of 10k EUR, I would get bonds yielding around 4% and have enough left over to buy a call spread for around €400. The problem is, of the relatively high quality EUR bonds that I can find for the appropriate maturity dates, it seems that most of them require a minimum face value investment of 100k per trade (at least at IBKR). This is sadly significantly beyond my capital allocation means. The spreads are also quite high, but I can be patient with getting the right fills. That said, my experience in bonds is quite limited. I understand the basic premise but have never purchased them before.


So my questions would be:

* Am I missing any major flaws/risks in the proposed strategy?

* Which bonds should I be looking at that could fit 10k or 20k lots? Is there a good, liquid alternative that yields 3-4%?

* Is there a simple way of FX hedging that I'm not seeing that would allow me to go for USD denominated T-bills instead?

I ran a simulation of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) into an S&amp;P500 ETF and compared it to the performance of Fixed-size Purchasing (FSP), and thought I might share some quick findings.

It was found that the rate of return (specifically, the IRR) was almost 1% higher for the DCA strategy. Over \~4 years, the capital gains for the DCA strategy was almost 3% higher than the FSP strategy.

**Point taken that the post is on the detail-rich side. For the tldr on in what situations this matters? Skip Methdology and read Key Findings and Updates. It may just influence your choice of ETFs.**

Dollar Cost Averaging: purchasing a fixed dollar amount periodically, regardless of price. More shares will be purchased when price is lower and vice versa. This tends to weight the portfolio such that its average cost basis is lower than the time-average of the underlying instrument. This is also easier to implement because retail investors typically have approximately the same dollar amount of disposable cash flow each month.

Fixed-size Purchasing: purchasing the same number of shares periodically, regardless of price.

# Methodology

&gt;!The instrument considered is the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (Ticker: VUAA.L), which is an Irish-domiciled accumulating fund that fully replicates SPX. Dividends are taxed at 15% and then reinvested into the fund automatically. The reason for using the VUAA.L is because I am not a tax resident of the U.S so an Irish-domiciled fund provides favorable withholding tax rates. This will not impact results qualitatively. The expense ratio of 0.07% per annum was taken into account.!&lt;

&gt;!A quantum of SGD 3000 was chosen to be invested into VUAA.L monthly in the DCA strategy. This includes all costs and fees of purchasing with an IBKR Pro Tiered account, which works out to about USD 1.9. At this size, trading costs as a percentage are near the minimum, and it was also relatively large compared to the price of each share.!&lt;

&gt;!The period of simulation runs from 1 Jun 2019 to 1 Apr 2023. Purchases were made on the 1st of each month.!&lt;

&gt;!For the FSP strategy, a fixed lot of 32 shares were purchased each month so that the total cost basis are as close as possible for the 2 strategies.!&lt;

&gt;!When calculating cost basis, all trading fees are included e.g market price = 100.00, trading costs = 1.90, cost basis = 101.90. The reason is that investors should be concerned primarily with their net cash outflow, not market price.!&lt;

&gt;!Because of the use of SGD, quantitative results are slightly but insignificantly influenced by the USDSGD rate. However, qualitative results are not affected.!&lt;

&gt;!I also wanted to find what was the expected effective annual yield one would get when purchasing SPX an an arbitrary time. To do this,!&lt;

1. &gt;!The time-averaged price of each year was taken. This would be the price one would expect to buy/sell the share during that year.!&lt;
2. &gt;!For each year, the effective annual yield required for the time-averaged price from 10 years ago to reach this year's time-averaged price was computed. This was termed the effective Trailing 10-year annual yield (eff. T10Y)!&lt;
3. &gt;!The arithmetic average of all eff. T10Y was computed to result in the Average eff. T10Y annual yield.!&lt;
4. &gt;!Only data from 1980-present was used!&lt;

&gt;!Average eff. T10Y yields for Treasuries were computed on the same principles, though exact steps differ.!&lt;

# Key findings

For the DCA strategy, a total of 1529 shares of VUAA.L were purchased at a total cost basis of SGD 138,680 at an average cost basis of SGD 90.72.

For the FSP strategy, a total of 1504 shares of VUAA.L were purchased at a total cost basis of USD 140,049, at an average cost basis of USD 93.12.

Less shares were received for a higher overall cost in the FSP strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

The internal rate of return (IRR) is the constant rate of compounding at which your portfolio would've arrived at the same present market value purchasing at the same dollar values and dates as you had. Think of it like the yield of a bond that you can purchase at any time in any amount, and this yield never ever changes. It is a good way of measuring the performance of your capital. The IRR can be computed by solving a high-order polynomial, or a simple search algorithm.

For the DCA strategy, the IRR was 6.14%.

For the FSP strategy, the IRR was 5.16%, 0.98% lower than the DCA strategy.

Over the 4 year period, the DCA strategy delivered overall 12.73% capital gains over cost basis compared to 9.81% for the FSP strategy, 2.91% higher.

IRRs may look depressed compared to averages because of current market conditions.

For the DCA strategy, the IRR is +3.78% over the average eff. T10Y Treasury annual yield, and -3..37% over the average eff. T10Y VUAA.L annual yield.

For the FSP strategy, the IRR is +2.82% over the average eff. T10Y Treasury yield, and -4.27% over the average eff. T10Y VUAA.L annual yield.

&amp;#x200B;

Would be happy to share data if anyone desires! Drop me a PM, since r/investing doesn't allow media.

**Updated with some insightful questions:**

* I have never heard of FSP.

FSP is just something I coined to refer to the practice of buying a fixed number of shares a month such that the total cost basis in a time period is equal to that of the DCA. It's an impossible strategy, which is why it isn't written about haha. To do so, one would require precise knowledge of future prices.

Mainly, FSP serves as a proxy to measure the internal rate of return of the VUAA.L index when sampled at monthly intervals. I thought that structuring it as a comparison of 2 strategies would provide more intuition about what the comparison means. The equivalent understanding of results is that DCA provides \~1% of outperformance over the internal rate of return of the security!

&amp;#x200B;

* Would the same conclusions hold up over other time periods?

The outperformance of DCA over FSP (or over the IRR of instrument) is trivially true, and can be seen from their formulae. However, the extent of outperformance will vary. I suspect that under conditions of 2010-2018, the extent of outperformance may be even greater. I would be happy to test a specific period for a specific instrument by request!

* In what situation would such information be helpful?

Generally, we're advised to go with the fund with the lowest expenses. Suppose you have $100 in cash to invest each month an ETF that costs $90 with an expense ratio of 0.07%. You would only be able to purchase 1 unit a month except in the 9th month, when you can purchase 2. As such, your strategy will be much closer to FSP than DCA, even though DCA is your intent. You might wonder how much growth you're giving up.

You might have an alternative investment (perhaps another ETF that tracks the same index) that has a way lower $5 unit cost, but has a marginally higher expense ratio e.g twice the expense ratio at 0.14%. At face value, most would decide in favor of the lower expense ratio, but the quantitative results suggest that - over the last 4 years at least - you would've been better off going with the higher expense ETF that allows you to DCA! Even under depressed conditions, the 1% outperformance works out to a 22% outperformance in terms of capital gains over 20 years. Not the biggest factor, by far, but not insignificant.

Another possibility is that Irish-domiciled ETFs may charge a 15% withholding tax on dividends, but that works out to less than 0.3% of total capital. If a US resident is able to DCA into an Irish-domiciled ETF, but not higher unit cost US-domiciled ones, then the Irish-domiciled ETFs could be a better choice despite additional taxes."|0.72|27|0|27

I’m trying to completely understand the benefits of a backdoor Roth IRA for me. I am 40 years old, single dad, and significantly behind on retirement savings. 2023 would be the first year starting this. 

2023 will also be the first year maxing the IRS limit ($22.5k) for my 401k. 

An HSA is available, but I’m not sure that I am comfortable with one (maybe my lack of understanding), as I have two children that I need to provide coverage for, and of course, myself. 

Rather than a Roth IRA, would it be wise to just invest more into my brokerage account instead? I’m dollar cost averaging with VTI. 

I’m finally at a point in my life where I have very little debt left (spent the last year aggressively paying it off), and now I’m hyper focused on getting on track with retirement savings. I currently make $150k annually and receive an annual bonus of anywhere between 8% - 15%.

t3_12tjm7s|1682034827|investing|Why AT&amp;T Stock Plunged 10% today|"$T stock falls 10% today on revenue miss, slower wireless customer growth, and tumbled free cash flow. The stock close at $17.65, and it is down 9% in the past year. The current dividend yield is 6%, which might be attractive to investors, as Fed would likely to reduce interest rate after summer, and high dividend stock would be a diversification play in investors’ portfolio.

Bears

1.  Decreasing free cash flow from 2.8 billion to 1 billion in Q1 2023 shows poor timing of working capital, as they have fewer receivable sales and large amount of capital investment beforehand.

2.  The cost of maintaining dominance in the wireless industry has been very high. AT&amp;T has spent $40 billion over the past three years on spectrum licenses, but this has not led to a significant increase in revenue.

3. AT&amp;T's massive debt load is a major concern. Even after spinning off WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T still has a high level of debt. This could make it difficult for the company to invest in its business and to return cash to shareholders

Bulls

1.  AT&amp;T Q1 revenue up 5.2%, 5G and fiber subscriber gains, with 424k postpaid phone net adds and 272k AT&amp;T Fiber net adds. Domestic wireless service revenues were up 5.2%, with best-ever first-quarter Mobility operating income. Consumer broadband revenues were up 7.3%, driven by AT&amp;T Fiber revenue growth of 30.7%. 

2.  After investing heavily in its network, AT&amp;T will have a nationwide 5G wireless network with deep spectrum and a fiber network that can reach nearly a quarter of the United States.

3. AT&amp;T is a leader in the telecommunications industry with a strong network and a loyal customer base, the company has the scale to remain a strong wireless competitor in the long run. With three dominant carriers, industry pricing should be more rational going forward"|0.63|8|0|8

t3_12tdwxh|1682022106|investing|Lifecore: Opportunity or Bust?|"Been following Lifecore (ticker: LFCR) for the past few of days. I believe the stock is a compelling long but would appreciate some pushback.

Lifecore is an oddity in the pharma industry. It has two main business branches in two very different sectors. One is the CDMO business that manufactures injectables for drug companies. Another one is their commodity Curation Foods business. Salad, avocado, olive oil, etc. This combination makes no sense at all but if you ever read Joel Greenblatt's fancy title books you'd be intrigued by possible shift in business mix. Perhaps a spin-off or other corporate action would unlock shareholder value...

Well that's exactly what is happening right now. On March 16th, Lifecore made three important announcements.

1. 2023 Q2 results with 11% revenue decline, going concern notice, and statements on breach of covenants.
2. Expansion of contract with existing customer including 10m upfront payment in cash and up to 15m capex reimbursement.
3. Statement on looking for strategic alternative.

So what does this mean for the stock? First trading day after the announcement, the market reacted violently. The stock plunged 70%. High debt level combined with going concern notice and exploration of strategic alternative is almost never a happy marriage and it wasn't a great start. Moreover, in months leading to Q2 announcement, Lifecore issued a note telling investors that previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon due to errors found in its Curation Foods business. Doomed! Or so it seemed. Interestingly, the stock went up 80% on the following trading day and has since held its ground in $3-4 range despite reasonably high borrow fees for shorting this name. Perhaps there's more to the story.

I decided to go over the business this past weekend and found a few more interesting items.

1. The company has an activist investor on the board and has been selling off its Curation Foods business for the last few years. They sold their avocado segment this year and now olive oil sale completes the sale of Curation Foods segment. Prior to this sale, I believe this was the last remaining thorn in Lifecore path towards receiving forbearance from lenders as well as attracting the best possible bids. Lifecore is finally a pure CDMO play well positioned to capture bids from both financial and strategic buyers. These assets are highly valued and often trade at EV/EBITDA multiple of larger than 15 due to regulatory and technical reasons. Lifecore guided around 32.5 million before the meltdown and winning their largest contract to date would most likely push EBITDA run rate to \~40m.
2. The revenue decline only happened for non-material reasons. Their customer pushed the schedule back by a quarter or two and hence the quarter numbers looked disappointing. But this means next quarter or the following one should have higher than normal numbers.
3. The liquidity statement is most likely the result of covenant breach and they should have enough cash on hand to run the business. Why? They just sold their avocado business for 17.5m (goes into paying down debt) and got 38.75m in converts with $7 strike price. They have enough cash to run the business and fund their capex. My best guess is that miscalculating the timing of (2) probably had some impact on the covenants and they now need to negotiate the terms with lenders. Right now these debts are callable at any moment and that's probably why they needed to issue the liquidity statement. Technically, they don’t have enough cash right now to meet the theoretical obligations that could arise from accelerated debt payment. Does it make sense for creditors to call the debts? No. They are much better off letting the sale process go through and getting a kick back for granting forbearance.
4. They hired Morgan Stanley for their strategic alternative process. If Morgan Stanley is the Morgan Stanley I know, they would not advise companies on a tiny 6 million dollar deal that may or may not go through. It's not the olive oil deal that needs Morgan Stanley. This is most likely the sale of the entire company. For what it's worth, when I interviewed for Morgan Stanley internship a while ago, the interviewer told me that they don't look at deals below 500m--pretty sure they do look at smaller deals as well but guessing it's the minority. I went to buyside straight out of college so don't have any first hand experience there but is more or less in line with conversations I had with friends in bulge bracket banks. Moreover, Morgan Stanley advised on a similar deal last year when Alcami traded hands. Lifecore has the right advisor.
5. The interest level in CDMO asset is wild. They have been steadily growing and industry experts I've spoken to all agree that they are most likely getting dozens of bids right now. Given that board owns significant amount of shares and the company has set its sight on sale process, we have the right conditions for maximization of shareholder returns.
6. The short interest increased going into the belated Q2 announcement on March 16th and since then FINRA data suggests that good amount of shorting has taken place. Historically, high short interest led to poor stock performance but occasionally you see stocks like Gamestop and Tesla that totally burns the short sellers. Given that I believe LFCR is a misunderstood situation and borrow fees are relatively high, the elevated short interest offers more reason to yield significant return should forbearance be granted and going concern notice removed.

Why are some people short this name?

Short thesis for this name is fairly straightforward. You have a company with business not matching the debt structure. The loans are current and they don’t have sufficient cash to meet all obligations. They just issued 38.75m in convertibles and even then they breached the covenants so the future looks bleak. Short!

On the other hand, the value of CDMO asset and high borrow rate make such thesis highly risky for the shorts and favorable for those looking at this name from the long side. What is this worth? We can look at other CDMO transactions for some guidance. Somewhat recent rumors of Catalent buyout sent the expectation to almost 20x EBITDA. Pantheon and Cook Pharma were both acquired for around 17 times EBITDA. If you apply a more conservative 15x multiple and subtract net debt, you are looking at a $14-15 stock. Apply 20x and you have a $20 stock.

What I see is a catalyst rich stock with next earnings right around the corner trading far below any reasonable transaction price (note: given that they released their Q2 only a couple of weeks ago Q3 could be delayed by few weeks). Should going concern be resolved by then, I believe people will begin speculating on potential buyout and shorts would be in deep trouble. Why would you be short should lenders agree to forbearance and acquirer could multiples of current price?

Would appreciate any feedback you have. I’m long LFCR but if there’s anything I’m missing happy to know about it."|0.5|0|0|0

Anyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the ""VT with tendency to the value factor"". It is a ""fund of funds"" with the following composition:

* Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%)
* Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%)
* Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%)
* Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%)
* Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%)
* Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%)
* Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%)
* Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%)
* Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%)
* Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%)
* State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)

I got this information from the website [etf.com/avge](https://etf.com/avge). But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.

So, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:

* [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv): In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE).
* [avge-holdings-grouped.csv](https://github.com/victornoleto/avge-holdings/blob/master/avge-holdings-grouped.csv): This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\*42.78% + 2.98%\*15.05%).

And, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.

|Name|Ticker|Weight|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%|
|Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%|
|Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%|
|Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%|
|JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|JPM|0.80%|
|Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%|
|Merck &amp; Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%|
|Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%|
|Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%|
|Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|

The fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.

# Next goals (which I will do when I have time):

* Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT;
* Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily."|0.84|16|0|16

I'm in the beginning stages of building up a deposit to start a mortgage one day and I was recommended to store my savings in a CD certificate of Deposit. So from my limited understanding, it's a sort of savings account where if you do not take out the money, you will have guarantied returns over your selected terms.

Looking at homestreet bank, I'm seeing a 7month term looking very attractive. However, if they were to hold my money for longer, the APY returns is lower at 3.5% vs 4.25% for the 7month.

t3_12s2hy5|1681923008|investing|Firearm manufacturing investing is riskier than you think.|"What you probably think of gun maker stocks is they're priced as industrials but with a lot of regulatory risks. That's all true, but you'd also be surprised just how many of these companies go bankrupt. Most larger brands that you would have heard have had filed for bankruptcy at some point, some pretty recently, and other companies have gone bankrupt during wartime when you'd think their business model is unsinkable. Especially with smaller firms, because the sheer volume of independent machinists that have come and gone over the years can boggle the mind.

It always comes down to at least one of very simple reasons:

1. People simply weren't buying the guns.
   1. A large portion of sales were supposed to go to a single customer (usually a government).
   2. The weapon was far too niche and there simply wasn't as much market for it as they thought.
   3. Weapons sales are strongly correlated to fear. When people fear other people, they buy weapons, meaning demand for weapons of different types varies by as much as 100% in a given year.
2. Didn't have money for requisite equipment.
   1. Specialized custom machines needed (lathes, forges, milling robot, rivet machine, etc).
   2. Many weapons may sit in storage for years before being sold while workers need salaries and rent needs paid.
3. Manufacturing less profitable than anticipated.
   1. Quality control entails frequent re-milling of parts and labor costs ensue.
   2. Competition with other manufacturers drives down prices.

The first reason is by far the most common. Recall that weapons are not consumer products and any decently made gun will outlive the owner. Also, they aren't cheap, and the user needs to balance getting a nice gun with what is within their budget. It's possible to spend ten grand on a handgun, and to be fair those guns have awesome precision, but the ordinary man who just needs a burglar gun might opt for an old west style revolver because they're cheap and super reliable. This highlights another major point because weapons sales can be a fat-margin high-risk business, and it can be a narrow-margin low-risk business often with no actual changes to the weapons themselves.

In any case, it's a business that heavily favors economies of scale but that is often impossible because what the customer needs isn't standard. I personally own a gun that I had custom assembled from Sig Sauer because I couldn't find anything on the market that had all the things I wanted. Also, since this is a defense industry all countries, often really tiny ones, want indigenous production to the point that state-sponsored patent violations have occurred throughout history. Often key parts of the manufacturing process are nationalized, meaning some overtly unprofitable factories are propped up artificially for decades.

For instance, the Mexican Federales use to buy guns from H&amp;K but decided they wanted to make their own but were too cheap to design their own. So they took the rifle they had in service and changed enough of the internals to circumvent patent laws and had uniformed soldiers assemble the guns.

High-risk startup behavior is far more common with arms than other heavy manufacturing. In one case during World War One, a group of 8 machinists got together and decided they'd make guns but they took all the contracts they could thinking they could just use the contracts as collateral for loans to set up a factory (of course governments only gave them said contracts because they neglected to mention they had no factory). Needless to say, they didn't get enough money together for the factory and the scheme fell through.

In another case in the 1950's some machinists made a new invention of a gun that could fire several different cartridges, and this was a very atomic-age gun with everything made of streamlined aluminum. Of course, costs proved higher than anticipated and sales lower than anticipated and even the chosen name of gun Wolverine proved a problem since that name was already taken. This story wasn't all sad as these guys actually kept their people working while the boss worked on finding them new jobs and sold the guns over the years following the shop's closure.

This highlights another point is that you should be more than a little skeptical when looking at small arms technology because it's never nearly as revolutionary as you think. Usually it's just a gimmick that may fill some niche but has no chance of going mainstream. For instance, Ammo Inc makes precision rounds, tracer rounds, and quiet rounds which all sounds nice if you're a US Army sniper but how big is that market? Probably not as big as you think, and its size and composition would vary year to year as army needs and budgets change.

To be fair, it is possible for an independent gunsmith to have prodigious success. One British guy and his family would make custom sniper rifles for Olympic competitive marksmen and they heard the British army announce a competition for a new sniper rifle. They entered their rifle just so they could say they did it, but to their surprise the British army snipers decided they wanted the Olympic rifle to be standard issue. That set these guys scrambling to make enough guns to start making deliveries whilst contracting a machine shop to help which was more problematic than it sounds since the machine shop kept taking shortcuts.

However, Remington Arms, which is among the oldest and most standard gun makers in the world, filed for bankruptcy twice in the last decade. They filed for bankruptcy in the middle of the Covid Panic when sales were prodigiously high. Of course, the reason was more long-term because they owed a lot of people money and didn't have the money coming in regularly.

Now I told you that so you'd understand this: Gunsmiths are really bad businessmen.

The men who want to be gunsmiths are really interested in producing bad\*\*\* weapons and are often divorced from what the average user wants or needs. The position is analogous to the legendary sword makers you see in Saxon and Norse sagas where the character is always a retired war veteran that crafts the finest tools of war for the noble hero. You understand, there's often ego involved in this. Samuel Colt himself was known to fire people for suggesting changes to his way of making the guns, and Colt would file for bankruptcy twice in his lifetime. When I bought a suppressor the company I bought it from insisted on helping with all the ATF paperwork which just made things even more complicated than they already were. I read elsewhere that these guys were so paranoid about mistakes that the firm had abnormally high turnover. The suppressor I got was nice, though.

To be fair, the guns that often make business sense are generally derided by all the men that know anything about guns. Case in point: Hi-Point guns are notoriously heavy and un-ergonomic but are accurate, reliable, and cheap. They did this by minimizing the number of parts that needed to be milled or had tight tolerance so they could use stamped sheet metal and plastic for most of the parts. This makes for a gun that nobody likes, but people buy anyway because it's really good at doing what guns do best: Sit in a drawer for decades just in case the owner has to deal with an \*\*\*hole someday.

In all good conscience, one cannot recommend any more than a market cap weighting of your investments to small arms manufacturers, which are less than 1% of the total market."|0.65|15|0|15

Until recently, market participants favored the 60/40 strategy, with the negative correlation between the two assets serving as a hedge against market uncertainty. However, due to rising inflation and increasing interest rates, everything has changed.

Although the Bloomberg 60/40 Index is up 6.3% this year after falling nearly 17% in 2022, BlackRock strategists believe that bond yields depend more on stock returns, suggesting that the approach to investing in fixed-income assets needs to be revised.

Specifically, the bank plans to focus on inflation-linked bonds and short-term bonds. One unclear aspect is the timing. Judging by the CPI and PPI, price growth has slowed, and the Fed is close to pausing. Could it be that BlackRock analysts expect the U.S. to follow the same fate as the U.K. with regards to inflation?

According to St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, the Federal Reserve could raise the rate all the way up to the 5.50%-5.75% range if new obstacles to price stability emerge. If this does in fact come to pass, a bet on the 60/40 strategy might not pay off.

Here’s is some insight on my situation. I am prior military and have invested, since my time in, roughly about 11,000 dollars into my TSP. I never paid attention to my TSP and left all of it in the G fund (cash reserve) during my entire time in active duty (shame I know). Now that I am out, I work a civilian job that has an employer 401k where I have approximately 5,000 dollars invested. The 401K is with the same brokerage firm where I have my other investments (minus the TSP) and the entirety of the 401K is invested in a retirement blend fund for 2065. I am leaving this job in about 3 months so my contribution to this 401K will also cease soon enough. So far these are the factors I am considering when contemplating this decision.

Move Funds:
1. Better compounding
2. Ease, all investments will be allocated to the same company
3. Chances are my next employer will provide a 401K with same brokerage company

Not Move Funds:
1. TSP allows me to move the invested amount between a wider array of funds and provides more freedom so I can diversify better. 401K is a set fund, can’t do anything with it

* If we look at Morningstar, [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/5ZxKrdL), V3AA loses to IMID since V3AA's inception (3/31/2021). Again, by a significant margin. IMID is up 0.26%, V3AA is down 4.06%. VT, ISAC, VWRA all match or beat IMID, whereas V3AA is significantly behind.

\[YTD numbers, Source: Fund Provider\]

* V3AA's NAV grew 8.00% this year, whereas IMID's NAV only grew 6.86% this year. VT grew 7.06% this year. Using these numbers, [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/0TWRlpL), V3AA will have grown a whopping 14.30% more over 36% years compared to IMID.

* [V3AA](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9470/esg-global-all-cap-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating)'s index grew 14.42% in 3 years, whereas [IMID](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-acwi-imi-ucits-etf-spyi-gy)'s index grew 15.65% in 3 years. With these numbers, [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/If1IJak), V3AA loses out by a whopping 21.94% over 36 years.

\[5 year p.a. index, Source: Fund Provider\]

* According to Vanguard's website [Vanguard UK](https://www.vanguard.co.uk/professional/product/etf/equity/9470/esg-global-all-cap-ucits-etf-usd-accumulating), V3AA's index grew 6.81% p.a. in the past 5 years. For IMID, [SSGA Eu](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-acwi-imi-ucits-etf-spyi-gy), that number is 6.58%. Factoring in TER, in these hypothetical numbers, that leaves us with 6.57% p.a. net for V3AA (TER 0.24%), and 6.41% p.a. net for IMID. Using these numbers, [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/bK8vFrY), V3AA's investment is 1.90% larger after 36 years.

\[5 year p.a. index, Source: Index Provider\]

* According to [FTSE Global All Cap Choice Index Factsheet](https://research.ftserussell.com/Analytics/FactSheets/Home/DownloadSingleIssue?issueName=FGACC&amp;isManual=False) the FTSE Global All Cap Choice Index grew 7.3% p.a. in the past 5 years, compared to the FTSE Global All Cap Non-Choice Index (7.1% p.a.). However, if we look at the 3 year data, it loses quite significantly, 14.9% p.a. to non-choice's 16.1% p.a. [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/AFSBvqo), that means V3AA loses out 14.60% over 36 years.

I have a decent ISA portfolio with Vanguard, being invested in ‘LifeStratagy 80% Equity Fund’. Was told this was good by my step dad who invests lots and he had got good returns over his life.

Would I be better off in leaving it there for the long game as it will start to go up eventually or withdraw and invest elsewhere after doing research?

t3_12pj0k6|1681742400|investing|The most crucial topic this week will involve corporate reports. Who are the leaders, and who are the laggards?|"Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.

I expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:

1️⃣ Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.

▪ **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.

2️⃣  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.

3️⃣ Energy and precious metals mining:

▪ Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.

▪ Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.

Laggards:

1️⃣ Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.

I'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.

Additionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.

2️⃣  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.

3️⃣  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.

Conclusion:

Adding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision."|0.57|3|0|3
t3_12peda2|1681734866|investing|What's next for the dollar?|"The  outlook for the USD hinges less on the Fed and more on market  expectations regarding the regulator's moves. Weak macroeconomic  indicators and the threat of a recession, for instance, suggest a  possible revision of monetary policy.

On  the other hand, robust corporate earnings leave room for maneuver. In  simpler terms, better data has a tendency to delay any changes in the  Fed's tone. This is why USD and government bond yields surged on Friday.

Regarding  the prospects of a recession, the fact that truck traffic on China's  domestic highways is down 8% (W/W) and the U.S. anticipates a 2% drop in  demand by 2023 implies that deflation could accelerate even without the  Fed's assistance.

For more  insights, we need to rely on macroeconomic data. The Beige Book,  reflecting the regulator's assessment of the nation's current economic  situation, will be released on Wednesday. Additionally, Fed officials  Williams, Waller, Bowman, and Bostic are scheduled to give speeches  throughout the week.

Lastly, U.S.  budget negotiations could prompt further declines in the dollar. This  week, Republicans will attempt to ""sell"" the idea of eliminating the  federal debt ceiling and of reducing government spending. But remember,  such a step cannot be taken without the approval of the Democrats, who  control the Senate."|0.44|0|0|0

Quote: ""(...)the average carbon intensity per unit of cash deployed by the US financial sector is 126.03 ktCO2e/billion USD."".

So, if you invest 100,000 without thinking too much, the businesses you become shareholder of will - on average - cause 12.6 tons of CO2 emissions annually - as much as about 3 cars with average operation cause per year.

t3_12oqxuk|1681682975|investing|Suggestion for USD domiciled portfolio for EU FIRE investor|"Hi  everyone, I live in US and plan to semi FIRE in EU in the next 1-2  years and I made a target portfolio (see below) to hopefully have a good  diversification and was somehow inspired by the [ginger ale po](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ginger-ale-portfolio/)[rtfolio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ginger-ale-portfolio/)  . In addition to this I also currently have a 2045 target fund in the  401k which I might convert to this target portfolio when I stop  contributing.

In addition to these  investments I also have quite a lot in cash equivalent assets (CD,  treasuries, MM, I-bonds) which I plan to partially DCA in the next 2  years (to give me comfort with doing FIRE in these crazy times) and  partially use for real-estate investment when I move to EU.

I  started to have second thoughts about allocation strategy since I\`m not  sure how much this portfolio could edge against USD loosing value to  EUR. I can make my worst case scenario assumptions for the cash  equivalent investments and probably the only reasonable thing to do is  to start converting USD to EUR for the short term needs (real-estate and  cash needed for next 3-5 years). However, I\`m not sure long-term how I  can be sure my portfolio could not drift too much when accounting for  USD/EUR conversion. I read that currency does not matter in the long run  but is this true only for the accumulation phase or also during  withdraws for retirement? My understanding is that allocating to  international stock is the easiest way to somehow mitigate this risk but  what about bonds? An additional complication is that I have double  USD/EU citizenship and I cannot invest in EU securities without  getting into complicated US tax issues. So I would prefer to keep my  money invested in an US brokerage. Is BNDX sufficient as a tilt and is  there an international equivalent of TLT (and would I need one)?  Any  other recommendation?

Thanks a lot!

I started to study about it and even found [some studies that suggest using leverage in investments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k) depending on your age.

In these studies I found some criticisms about this type of approach, the main one being ""volatility decay"". In discussions (right here on reddit, for example) I see that most argue that leveraged ETFs are not for the long term.

Even with all the winds blowing to the side ""*Hey Victor, forget about it... leave it alone*"", I decided to do a test encompassing a huge period of time. As written in the title, I used a [dataset from 1927 to 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryhan117/sp-500-historical-data).

&gt;I found this [other dataset that has a history from 1871 to 2018](https://github.com/datasets/s-and-p-500/blob/master/data/data.csv). However, these are monthly and not daily closing values and since I would like to evaluate the behavior of the daily volatility decay, I decided not to use it to complement a longer period.  
&gt;  
&gt;I couldn't find a CSV containing the daily data for 2020 to date. However, I committed the [project on github](https://github.com/victornoleto/sp500-leverage) for those who want to either complement it with a more complete dataset or even check out the algorithm I used to calculate leverage.

# Results

You can see the [graph of the results in this link](https://victornoleto.github.io/sp500-leverage/). Just the image of the results in this [other link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victornoleto/sp500-leverage/master/result.png).

**I'm confused about why someone would hold high dividend-yielding positions in an IRA.** (And maybe I have some doubts about dividends in general.) Here are two points I could think of in favor of dividend stocks in an IRA and what I think about them.

1 - Usually I hear ""dividends are desirable because they provide passive income."" But that's moot in an IRA since you're not cashing out on those dividends, at least for a while if you're young.

2 - But maybe there are other +1's as to holding high dividend positions in an IRA. For instance, if I choose to automatically reinvest my dividends, that's (semi)continuous interest, which maybe leads to substantial asset growth over time. **But something I've never understood -- are dividend payouts (even close to) large enough that the interest induced by reinvesting them could be comparable to the long-term growth of plain old stocks/funds/etc. (that are not ""high dividend yielding"" nor selected based on their dividend potential)?** Because if not, then this 2nd point is moot also--as far as accruing value goes, it would be better to just buy ordinary funds/stocks.

I was also seeing claims of uncorrelated returns because in some cases businesses moving operations out of the US would look to emerging markets.

Yet, in the past ~20 years VWO has sucked when compared to VOO. It is not even due to wild fluctuations. The return on VWO has been consistently lower. If I were shown both return vs. time on the same plot I would think VOO was the higher-risk, higher-volatility investment.

&gt;Charles Schwab Corp. stunned Wall Street in 2019 by slashing trading commissions to zero, forcing its competitors to adapt. The move amounted to a big bet that its bank — rather than its well-known discount brokerage — would keep driving profits.

&gt;For a while, it worked to perfection. The pandemic hit, interest rates were pinned near historic lows, and Schwab raked in billions as the fees it had forsaken were offset by what the company earned from its banking operation.

&gt;But last month’s collapse of three US banks, the industry’s worst crisis since 2008, has turned that wager on its head. 

&gt;Now Schwab, the biggest publicly traded US brokerage, faces one of the most painful moments in its 50-year history. After a rapid surge in interest rates, deposits sank while unrealized losses swelled. The stock plunged 33% in March, its worst month since 1987.

&gt;Investors will be looking for signs of Schwab’s longer-term prognosis on Monday, when it reports first-quarter results. In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts sharply reduced their profit estimates. 

&gt;Deposits are a key focus.

&gt;If they decline too far, Schwab could eventually be forced to sell securities at a loss. Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger, 62, and billionaire founder Charles Schwab, 85, issued two joint statements in recent weeks to reassure investors that there’s a “near-zero” chance of that. On April 6, they touted $53 billion of client assets that arrived in March, the second-largest for that month on record.

&gt;“What we’ll be most keen to see is: did the pace of deposits leaving accelerate?” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Neil Sipes. “Can they quantify how much more there is to go?” 

&gt;Some investors decided not to wait. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, which had been among Schwab’s top 15 shareholders at year-end, sold its entire $1.4 billion stake during last month’s turmoil, the Financial Times reported Friday.

&gt;“We didn’t see an existential risk but they were caught up in the sentiment around banks,” Mark Barker, head of international at the investment firm, told the FT. “With all the inflows to money-market funds Charles Schwab is losing deposits revenue.” 

&gt;Schwab defies easy classification. Known for pioneering cheap stock trading, it grew into one of the largest US banks. The firm weathered seismic changes over five decades, including the dot-com bust, the dawn of low-cost index products and the era of free trading it ushered in.

&gt;Cash has become even more important since then.

&gt;While the move to zero-fee trading paved the way for its $26 billion purchase of TD Ameritrade, it also knocked out an income stream that totaled $763 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in 2018.

&gt;Because Schwab generates most of its money from customer funds idling in low-yielding accounts — which it “sweeps” into its bank arm — the firm needed somewhere to invest incoming cash as trading surged. 

&gt;Like Silicon Valley Bank, the largest of the three lenders that imploded last month, Schwab plowed into debt that will take five years or more to mature. Such securities, backed by the US government, are supposed to be among the safest available — a seemingly good fit for a company known for its conservative approach to money-management.

&gt;The risk was that interest rates could rise. 

&gt;That’s exactly what started to happen in early 2022, as the Federal Reserve began to hike aggressively. The investments are now underwater, though Schwab won’t have to book a loss unless it’s forced to sell them. 

&gt;“We have taken relatively little risk in our portfolio,” founder Schwab and Bettinger said in a March 23 statement, noting that more than 80% of deposits are FDIC-insured. Two weeks later, they predicted that the migration to higher-yielding investments would ease. “That trend eventually reaches a plateau,” they said. 

&gt;Company spokeswoman Mayura Hooper said the firm offers many ways for clients to make the most of their cash.

&gt;“Cash sweep is just the starting point for uninvested cash at Schwab,” Hooper said in a statement. 

&gt;Whether the remaining deposits stay put will depend to a degree on the big independent advisers that buttress Schwab’s business. They’re increasingly focused on getting the best returns for clients’ cash.

&gt;Charles Sachs, chief investment officer at Kaufman Rossin Wealth, is among them. He moves customer money from Schwab sweep accounts into its higher-yielding money-market funds, on almost a daily basis.

&gt;“This is a frustration,” Sachs said. “It creates unnecessary work for us.” 

&gt;At Fidelity Investments some sweep accounts earn more than 4%, with no extra effort required. Schwab offers 0.45%.

&gt;“Nobody likes to be sitting, not earning money on your dollars when you could be,” Sachs said, adding that he complained to Schwab. “They’re going to need to do something.”

&gt;Jon Ulin, managing principal of Ulin &amp; Co., a private wealth adviser in Boca Raton, Florida, said that some clients have asked questions about Schwab’s balance sheet and plummeting share price. He said Schwab’s business is sturdy.

&gt;**“I don’t have any concern at all,” he said. “The US government would intervene if something got worse.”**

&gt;In January, Schwab told investors that it believed the firm can increase profitability in coming years as low-yielding assets mature, freeing it up to invest in securities with higher yields. But this strategy hinges on a number of assumptions, particularly that deposit flight will ebb.
 
 &gt;The firm’s leaders estimated in January that interest-earning assets had an additional 8% to 12% to fall from year-end levels, in part because they looked to the last interest rate hiking cycle, which ended in 2019, for a template.

&gt;They also assumed the firm’s high-cost borrowing would be temporary.

&gt;To shore up its business in the short term, Schwab has been relying on loans. The firm said it had $100 billion in cash flow and more than $300 billion available from the Federal Home Loan Bank system, among other options.

&gt;It has already drawn from that pool.

&gt;Schwab became the largest borrower from its local branch of the system, the Dallas FHLB, in 2022, according to regulatory filings. Schwab borrowed $12.4 billion from it last year, and an additional $13 billion so far this year, according to its annual report. 

&gt;Against that backdrop, Schwab continued to reward shareholders by increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.

&gt;Wall Street analysts are still confident in Schwab. Most have the equivalent of a “buy” rating on the company’s stock. In yet another sign of Schwab’s unique place in the US financial system, some analysts who cover it primarily focus on brokerages and exchanges — not big banks. In its scale and layout, Schwab remains a bit of an anomaly.

&gt;“They’re not a typical bank,” said Piper Sandler analyst Rich Repetto. “It’s a unique business model.”"|0.78|58|0|58
t3_12m4490|1681492123|investing|Can someone explain how paying 20 times earnings for 12% growth and 1% dividend makes sense in the long term?|"Hey everyone, 
 
I'm a bit confused about a potential investment opportunity (don't want to name specifically) and was hoping someone could help shed some light on it. 
 
The company in question has a P/E ratio of 20, 12% expected earnings growth (based on long time past performance), and a 1% average dividend payout (at a constant growth rate) over a 10 year period.

| Year Range | Earnings | Dividend | Total Earnings | Price per Earnings |
|------------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| 0-10       | 3.10     | 0.03     | 3.13           | 6.39               |
| 10-20      | 7.49     | 0.08     | 7.57           | 2.64               |
| 20-23      | 10.84    | 0.11     | 10.95         | 2.11               |
| 23-24      | 15.34    | 0.15     | 15.50         | 1.62               |
| 24-25      | 21.61    | 0.22     | 21.83         | 1.23               |
| 25-26      | 30.42    | 0.30     | 30.72         | 0.92               |
  
My question is, how does it make sense to pay 20 times earnings for this investment? The only way I would make money is if the P/E ratio remains the same in the future, which seems like a big gamble to me. Data shows on average, companies survived only 10-20Y
 
I understand the concept of compounding returns, but I'm not sure how to apply it to this situation. Could someone provide a numerical rationale to explain how this investment could potentially make sense in the long term?

I thought that the rate was locked for 6 months from the time of purchase, not when the new rate is announced? Either way, I can't figure out how it came to $10,320. If it were at the current rate of 6.89%, it should still be more than that.

1. How and when does the IRS ask for proof of qualifying expenses? At tax time? At withdrawal time? Do I have to mail them some kind of proof or do they see it somewhere?

2. Should I withdraw and have taxes taken out at that time or pay them later with my tax filing? Which way would avoid the penalty?

3. Withdraw to pay for current year expenses… does that mean I can only withdraw enough NOW for the fall semester and will have to take another withdrawal for Spring semester in January to get me through 2024?

4. Are qualified expenses considered only what is left needing funding after I receive loans and grants? (Based on the financial package provided from the college regarding room and board, tuition, etc)

t3_12kwqq9|1681407162|investing|Is now (still) a good time to buy i-bonds?|"Please be patient, I know zero about investment 😓

My husband and I recently talked about getting more serious with investing. I remember last year a friend mentioned buying i-bonds as the interest rate was high - we were welcoming a new baby and occupied so I didn't look much into it. I just remember it now...

From my quick google search, I keep seeing ""buy before April 27 to lock in the rate"" or something like that. Wouldn't the rate change in May 1st anyway when the new rate is announced? So if we buy now, we'd have 2-3 weeks of earning the 6.xx% interest rate. And I saw that the rate is predicted to be ~3.xx% in May, is that bad? I don't want to ""miss the deadline"" but I also don't want to lose out on the opportunity.

I saw that you can't touch the money for the first year, and withdrawal before 5 years would have a penalty. That's fine as we don't need that money anytime soon. Anything is better than the 0.1% interest rate we have from our bank savings account right now. We'll diversify our investment so not everything will go to i-bonds.

But, is i-bonds a good starting point? Or should we look into other things? I'm very overwhelmed with all the options and not sure where to start learning..."|0.47|0|0|0
t3_12kw9fm|1681406234|investing|Investing in foreign currencies|"Does anyone here successfully invest in foreign currencies? 

My curiosity stems from when the Euro was previously 1-1 recently with the USD. As a USD holder (and someone who enjoys traveling), would it make sense to say take several foreign currencies and get them on what you would deem a favorable ratio, for the possible trip down the road, or even for a swap back if the exchange rate changes? Is this worth the time/fees? Take for instance $5000 USD traded for Euros today to just sit on for any future travels worst case scenario, but also for the speculation that if the USD weakens I could swap it back if it’s not used to make some extra money? While the USD-EUR would be the most practical currency to speculate wrong on for traveling (it’d get used eventually), should I also consider some volatile currencies for more trading types of opportunities (SA Rand? Etc).

This peaks my interest as it seems like the type of small investment where I could make a buck or 2 on currencies that trend favorably, if not I could just hold them until I can spend them abroad.

t3_12kv3aj|1681404021|investing|Advice for a kid in the military.|"Hello! 

I’ll just cut to the chase. I’m currently a 19 year old E3 in the Air Force. Using Excel, I’ve set up a spending plan in regards to income versus expenses.

I figured out that I would like to allocate 15% of my income (after expenses) towards investing but I’m not quite sure where to start.

I have attended classes, and watched a lot of videos - so I have a very basic understanding of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and how those investment options actually work.

I know that I want to put some of my investment allocation into longer-term lower risk investments that will help aid in my finances after retirement (I also have a separate allocation for my 401(k)). But, I also know that a lot of people say to take risks early, so I would also like to find some investment opportunities that might be a little bit more high risk, or short term.

The problem is, I’m not sure how much of that 15% should go into which - and I haven’t determined what exactly I’d like to invest in for each of those. Should I invest in dividend ETFs or should I just buy single shares of companies in the Fortune 500 and wait 10 years?

For longer-term, should I invest in bonds - or should I save part of my investment allocation for real estate later on when the housing market inevitably crashes and I can buy low?

Just some things I’ve been thinking about, and was looking to get some general advice from people who are much smarter than me.

Like I said, I have very very rudimentary and basic knowledge. Very much a novice in the investing world.

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!"|0.6|3|0|3
t3_12kv023|1681403840|investing|LEAPS for Lifecycle Investing|"I have recently encountered the paper from Ayres and Nalebuff about lifecycle investing and leverage, and wanted to look at the feasibility of it in the current context.

Three options I am considering are:

\- using a leveraged ETF  
\- using margin investing: 7% on interactive brokers right now  
\- using LEAPS: buying long-term deep ITM call options.

I'm currently exploring this last option.

Say I want to expose myself to 100 shares of SPY. As time of writing, it trades at around $410 per share.

I could buy a call option with strike price $205 at expiry date March 2025 (two years from now), at a price of $217.

With a cost of $21,700, I am exposed to 100 shares of SPY, which makes me about 2x leveraged.

If the price of SPY remains the same until then, I should be able to sell by call options at $205, losing 6% of my investment.

In the worst case, SPY crumbles below $205, never recovers, and I lose the whole $21,700.

Is my understanding correct? Does that mean that using third strategy is equivalent to borrowing at an interest of \~3% per year?"|0.72|9|0|9

I could have found a better graph for this, but this graph is sufficient in illustrating my point. My point is that GDP growth rates are persistently below their historical norms. Without being too specific, we used to see emerging economies grow at at 8% pa, and now they grow less than that. We used to see advanced economies grow at 2.5% to 3% pa, and now they grow less than that (about 1.5% to 2% pa).

Now, I'm generalising massively here, as of course some countries report crazy growth rates in specific years, and some countries in the 'advanced economies' or 'emerging economies' grouping persistently outperform their peers.

However, my point is: growth rates are lower across every generalizable category of economies whether it be emerging economies or advanced economies. 

What I want to know is; how will this impact returns on equities?

This is obviously a really complicated question, the relationship between asset price growth and productivity growth are not clear cut. However, I would \*think\* that if we could hold all else equal, that sustained lower productivity growth would mean lower investment returns.

What if in general, the worlds growth looked a \*little\* more like Japan's economic growth of the last 20 years? What would that mean for the returns on global equities?"|0.89|85|0|85

Make sure to know which month your I bond will be earning the new upcoming interest rate (3.38%). For example, an I bond purchased in November 2021 will have the first interest payment with the new 3.38% rate on September 1st 2023. If purchased in March 2022, that would be January 1st 2024.

* The interest from I bonds are exempt from state and local taxes. Look at the tax equivalent yield when comparing to other investments. For example, the new rate starting in May 2023 will be 3.38%, and my state tax rate is 9.3%, so the tax equivalent yield is about 3.73%.
* Interest is tax deferred until the I bond is redeemed (unless you have purposely been reporting the interest on your tax return each year). You may want to hold off on selling during this year if you expect to be in a lower federal tax bracket in the following year.

t3_12jn7v8|1681308131|investing|Should average person invest in individual muni bonds?|"I like not having share price volitality, near guarantee of not losing money if held to maturity, and consistent and near guarantee interest earnings.   Plus there's no expense ratio to pay, and no commission if buying the new issues.

However, back right before 2008, I was told, ""YOU DON'T LOSE MONEY IN MUTUAL FUNDS"", because the fund managers constantly trade stocks to avoid losses in mutual funds.  I then lost a lot.  A lot.  I feel I gained back my losses through 15 years of working and saving totally outside of investing.   However, I would be much better off had I not touched those damnable mutual funds.

I kind of wonder if I'll be falling into the same fallacy with muni bonds I did with stock mutual funds    Perhaps, average person should just buy FDIC insured brokerage CDs instead of muni bonds?   

For average people, it may be frugal living within one's means while saving money as much as you can would be the way to a reasonabe financial stability instead of maxing out in 401 K or retirement accounts or chasing the market.

In 2017, for instance, 432 IPOs in Mainland China saw their share prices pop by c.44% on their first day of trading (the 44% cap imposed by regulators for the first day of trading prevented more dramatic pops).

I am wondering what to do in the case of an invasion China in Taiwan. I see two scenarios I would like to discuss.

1. China invades Taiwan and US are not intervene

In this case I think there will be a huge drop in all stocks initially. But to make it short I think some will recover quickly like military stuff. There will be market that don´t suffer too much like industrie that is not relying on the newest semi conductor chips. Companies like ASML and wafer producer which are not in taiwan can maybe take advantage of this situation and even grow since domestic demand of non involved countries will be huge. Nevertheless this is probably still a market you want to go rather short.

2. China invades Taiwan and US and its allies intervene.

This is actually the scenario why I opened this thread. For this scenario I am sure the global market will completely collapse. Health, Automotive, Chemical, the finance sector and with it most public companies who are relying on a cash flow so, even the steel industrie and sectors that  actually could profit from a WW3 scenario.   
Only, maybe, the military sector will give some gains here. But with the finance sector going down I assume military public companies will be made private and transfered to the GOV.   
Considering the global impact and the unpredictable behavior of supervisory authority like the SEC who could freeze the stock markets completly I think its not a bad idea to keep all money away from the stock market. I could also imagne collapses of currencies like the EU since the eurozone is already instable. But these are just some guesses.

Then one could argue go in Gold. But history has shown that states can use expropriation to take such investments away from one. Some voices say, and I think maybe they have a good point here, go to a unimportant emerging country that is used to be poor and stay there with your capital till the war is over.

What do you think would be the right investments strategy for these two scenarios and why exactly?"|0.35|0|0|0

&gt;When KPMG LLP gave Silicon Valley Bank a clean bill of health just 14 days before the lender collapsed, the Big Four audit firm flagged potential losses on loans as a so-called critical audit matter. But the audit opinion was silent on what actually brought down the bank—its unrealized bond losses and ability to hold them given a reliance on potentially flighty deposits.

&gt;“The auditors failed to mention the fire in the basement or the box of dynamite on the first floor, but they did point out the peeling paint on the flower box,” said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor. “How could they miss the interest-rate risk?”

&gt;The current banking crisis is the first big test of critical audit matters, a measure designed to help investors decode risks and uncertainties buried in financial statements. 

&gt;Audit regulator Public Company Accounting Oversight Board introduced critical audit matters in 2017 to “breathe life into the audit report.” Described as the biggest shake-up in audits in 70 years, the new standard was meant to make audit opinions more useful to investors.

&gt;So far, though, critical audit matters have failed to shed light on issues that have caused a collapse of confidence among depositors and investors in many small and midsize banks.

&gt;Auditors are required to record any critical audit matters when they sign off on a public company’s books. Regulators define these as matters that have a significant impact on the financial statements and involve “especially challenging, subjective or complex” judgments by the auditors.

&gt;Silicon Valley Bank’s unrealized losses in its bond portfolio appear to “meet every definition of a possible critical audit matter,” said Martin Baumann, a former chief auditor at the PCAOB who had a leading role in designing the new measure.

&gt;The latest banking crisis has exposed the gamble some banks took in betting heavily on long-term government bonds, which last year plunged in value as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. 

&gt;Banks can keep these losses off their books by classifying their bondholdings as “held to maturity,” or intended never to be sold, allowing them to be held at cost rather than fair value. The banking industry last year relied more heavily on this accounting maneuver, as rising rates pummeled balance sheets.    

&gt;Accounting rules say banks can classify bonds as held to maturity only if they have both the intent and ability to hold on to them, rather than having to sell them to meet demands for withdrawals. For well-capitalized banks, that likely isn’t a tough judgment call to make.

&gt;But it is a much more nuanced issue for many of the lenders at the center of the latest banking crisis. Unlike the biggest banks, smaller banks are largely reliant on deposits for funding, which can prove flighty in stressed times, calling into question a bank’s ability to indefinitely hold long-term assets.

&gt;The parent of Silicon Valley Bank, SVB Financial Group SIVBQ had $91 billion of held-to-maturity bonds on its Dec. 31 balance sheet, which a footnote said had a fair value of just $76 billion. That $15 billion loss was big enough to wipe out most of the bank’s total equity of $16 billion at year-end.

&gt;The lender’s total deposits had shrunk from the previous year, its financial statements showed. What’s more, its reported cash was only around 8% of total deposits, heightening the risk it would need to sell long-term assets if significant numbers of its depositors left. 

&gt;That appears to tick all the boxes for the auditor to highlight this issue as a critical audit matter. “The judgment as to whether or not Silicon Valley Bank had the ability to hold these securities to maturity was certainly a complex question, it was material to investors, and it is hard to see how liquidity was not a matter for discussion with the audit committee,” said Mr. Baumann, who is also a former senior partner at Big Four audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. 

&gt;“I’m not the auditor of the bank and I don’t know if this [bonds issue] should have been included in the auditor’s report,” he added. “But as the lead author of the standard, this certainly is the kind of item that we had in mind for critical audit matters.”

&gt;Representatives of the accounting industry pushed back on suggestions auditors should have sounded the alarm ahead of the crisis. Dennis McGowan, vice president of professional practice at the Center for Audit Quality, said accounting standards don’t require companies to anticipate “extremely remote” scenarios in deciding whether they can classify bonds as held to maturity. 

&gt;“Some of what’s happened could not have been anticipated. Social media fueled the withdrawals from one bank, for example,” Mr. McGowan said. “Auditors don’t have a crystal ball to anticipate that kind of thing.”

&gt;KPMG’s audit of Silicon Valley Bank could be tested in court if shareholders decide to include the firm in the likely lawsuits. 

&gt;“The lack of a relevant critical audit matter and of a going concern are going to come up if it comes to litigation,” said Jack Castonguay, an accounting professor at Hofstra University. He added that it was difficult to judge KPMG’s audit without seeing the firm’s work papers or knowing what risks it discussed with SVB’s audit committee.

&gt;A KPMG spokesman declined to comment. In response to a request for comment to SVB’s successor bank, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve cited the regulator’s description of the bank’s failure as a “textbook case of mismanagement.” She declined to comment on KPMG’s audit of the lender. 

&gt;Do you think changes should or will be made to the way banks are audited as a result of the collapse of SVB and Signature? Join the conversation below.

&gt;Auditors’ apparent blind spot on the interplay of interest-rate and liquidity risks isn’t confined to Silicon Valley Bank. 

&gt;Auditors for nine other U.S. banks most exposed to bond losses also didn’t flag this as an issue when they signed off on the financial statements for 2022, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal

&gt;The Journal reviewed the audit opinions for the 10 small to midsize U.S. banks that last year reported the highest losses on held-to-maturity securities as a proportion of their shareholder equity, based on data from research-firm Calcbench. Silicon Valley Bank ranked second on the list. 

&gt;None of the auditors included a critical audit matter related to the bank’s treatment of the bonds. Instead, nine of the 10 reported a critical audit matter for estimated losses from loans or other bad debts. That is the risk that brought down banks in the 2008 financial crisis. Auditors didn’t report any critical audit matter for one of the banks, the analysis found.

&gt;A PCAOB spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the lack of critical audit matters related to the latest crisis was a reflection of the effectiveness of the measure. 

&gt;“Unfortunately CAMS have not been used as fully as we had hoped for,” the former regulator Mr. Baumann said."|0.88|283|0|283

Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?

# Operations

First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.

* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts
* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion
* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.

The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.

# Competition

When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.

***US market***  
In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.

***Worldwide***  
In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.

***Total Payment Volume competition***  
Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.

# Financials metrics

We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?

To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.

Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:

* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%
* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%
* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%
* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%

Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.

# Analyst Expectations

Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:

* 18.33% in 2023
* 15.28% in 2024
* 13.07% in 2025

In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.

Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.

# Valuation

This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:

* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.
* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94
* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2
* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1
* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4

The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.

One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.

The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.

The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.

# Conclusion

Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.

What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?"|0.83|73|0|73

The two reasons that I can think of that will force a Fed rate decrease are the following:  
1. March, April, May of last year showed significant month on month CPI increase. If the March, April, May reports of this year show a smaller month on month inflation, then the annualized CPI reading might fall down to 4%. This is still not in the 2% territory that Fed targets. But might be enough to pull back the rates by 50 bp or something maybe?

2. If the inflation falls down to below 5% rate and the Fed is paying 5.25% in interest, then people will say that Fed is contributing to the inflation? And that will force Fed to decrease the rates? Fed's rate cannot be more than the current inflation rate right?

You know the one I'm talking about: the one where you need to click a button to type in every character in your password, that also prevents auto-fill from password managers as well.

I am here to show you all how to fix this permanently (or at least until they change the website). As some of the more tech-savvy of you may know, the reason this input box is blocked from typing and autocomplete is because of the presence of a couple HTML attributes. If you right-click on the input box and inspect the element using dev tools, you'll see two attributes `readonly=""readonly""` and `autocomplete=""off""` attached to it. You can manually delete these (delete the entire attribute, not just the value on the right-hand side of the `=`) and then type in your password like a normal human being using your physical keyboard or password manager auto-fill.

However, the above solution, while an improvement, is very manual and can be kind of annoying to perform every single time.

t3_12glpqn|1681052246|investing|Do you think real estate pricing has become too efficient? What do you think is the best area/asset class to find alpha?|" Hello everyone,

Over the past 10-15 years, the increased presence of institutional investors and pricing technology has made it harder, although not impossible, to source opportunities and create above market returns within real estate. The increased sophistication of owners (previously ""mom and pop"", now investment firms) has allowed them to focus on maximizing net operating income, and therefore limiting operating inefficiencies. This has been most pronounced in the multifamily market.

What do you you believe will be the next sector/asset that these institutions will jump to? I am interested to hear your thoughts on the sectors you believe currently posses pricing or operational inefficiencies, either within real estate or outside of real estate.

t3_12gl64f|1681050900|investing|Question about Series I Bond rate changes|"Probably a bit of an amateur question.

If you have an I-bond that was not issued during May or November, how do rate changes work?  I understand that they still would change every six months - e.g. if I buy a bond in April, the rate is going to change in October.

However, let's take last year as an example...the composite rate on a bond issued in Apr'22 was 7.12%.  It would change to 9.62% in Oct'22.  The month after that, the variable rate changed to 6.48%.

When does the Apr'22 issued bond start accruing at the 6.48%?  Would it accrue at 9.62% through March'23 and then change to 6.48% in April (current month)?  Trying to understand the I-bond accrual calculation better."|0.85|37|0|37

Last year I purchased my first property (duplex, I’m living in one unit, renting out the other), and my long term goals include purchasing more real estate (buy &amp; hold, rent out), to eventually do some travelling.
So, the 3 things I’m currently looking into:
#1. Paying down my mortgage ($690k, 3.99% fixed rate), as the beginning of my term is the highest interest, I thought it might make sense to start throwing down 5k, 10k here and there to pay down some principal. 
#2. Renovating my current property. It’s somewhat dated, I was thinking I could renovate the property, refinance it and purchase another property.
#3. Investing in another property. I don’t have the funds yet, but I could keep saving for another couple of years and will have enough for a down payment. Although I’m not sure what I would do with the money in the meantime, of course a savings account would do me no good (maybe GIC?).

t3_12gedn5|1681032215|investing|Recontextualizing the EMH to make it more intuitive|"EMH is not very controversial amongst the academics and (even) some great active fund managers, Howard Marks is an active manager yet in his books mastering the market cycle and the most important thing he agrees with basic tenets of it, yet there is so much confusion about in retail circles, and professional investors too. Bill Ackman seems to talk smack about it, and everyone talks about his “greatest trade ever” during COVID crash forgetting that he trailed the market massively, having pretty much flat returns during one of the greatest bulls runs ever in the 2010s.

A lot of the misunderstandings I think stem from the confusing wording and highly technical language, as well as some models of it, which even further confuse the readers. The theoretical perfect model definitions of it can easily be easily smacked with some exceptions to the rule, and yet the practical applications are powerful. Below are some examples of what I mean:

Weak and strong EMH and the idea of “priced in”. For one, I don’t know anyone who seriously believes in strong version of EMH. In his podcast, Ben Felix asked Eugene Fama what he thinks about the GameStop ordeal to which Eugene Fama replied that EMH is a model that approximates reality, and it is not an ideal representation of it, and just like in any other model, there will be some events that do not fit it. In other words, the technical definition of EMH overstates it’s predicting powers (when it doesn’t even reflect the views of its founding fathers), while also giving an unintuitive explanation 

Rationality of the markets. The issue with this is that rationality always becomes apparent in hindsight. It’s not immediately obvious how events will unfold, and only in retrospect it’s easy to say that the market acted irrationally. It was not immediately clear how covid would unfold, and the degree of the intervention of the CBs. In 2008 the fed let Lehman collapse which lead to a credit crunch. A panic sell at the time would have benefited the investor, and yet the entry point of march 2009 would have been nearly impossible to predict. In other words, EMH is not saying that irrationality as defined by 20/20 hindsight is not possible, just that it’s unlikely you will always be on the right side of the decision making.

Exceptions to the rule. Markets work on probabilities, and it’s not crazy to think that some investors could have beat the market. Then again, we have to define what the market is. Buffet is usually given as an example, but comparing his returns to SP500 is not exactly correct when he very clearly has a value and size tilt, which are integral to EMH. Many studies in fact show Buffet’s returns are in line when compared to the correct benchmarks. There are other examples too, like Jim Simmons who clearly demonstrates that at least some inefficiencies very likely exist in the market too, although it’s mportant to consider that we don’t actually know what he does, and that he uses up to 10x leverage. Still, some people will have an insight that the market has clearly missed out like Burry during 2008 housing crisis. EMH doesn’t make that an impossibility, just a high improbability (we’re still talking about it 15 years later)

This is why in multiple discussions with my friends and colleagues I have preferred to redefine EMH from: “market prices reflect all available information” to a much more practical and intuitive definition of: “it’s highly unlikely that anyone could beat their given benchmark on a risk adjusted basis”. After all, as shown above, being lucky, having a brilliant insight, leveraging yourself or factor tilting doesn’t disprove EMH. What EMH means is that without luck or insanely extraordinary skill (on par with one in millions) no one can beat the overall market without factor tilting or taking on more risk"|0.72|3|0|3

“Refinancing risks are front and center” for owners of properties from office buildings to stores and warehouses, Morgan Stanley analysts including James Egan wrote in a note this past week. “The maturity wall here is front-loaded. So are the associated risks.”

The investment bank estimates office and retail property valuations could fall as much as 40% from peak to trough, increasing the risk of defaults.

Adding to the headache, small and regional banks — the biggest source of credit to the industry last year — have been rocked by deposit outflows following the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, raising concerns that will crimp their ability to provide finance to borrowers.

I am a 28 year old male, married and I live in the SF Bay Area. I started working in 2020 and since then I have accumulated ~27k into my retirement account. My employer offers a  401k which is self-managed account. Beginning of this year I have started contributing $1000 every month and my employer contributes additional 3% (there is no matching and the contribution is fixed). So roughly speaking I would add 1400-1500/month to my 401k. 

Current strategy:
1) Since the interest rates are high I am buying short term (mostly 3m) t-bills with the cash I have (~$400/month)

2) I buy 3 VOO stocks between 15-20th of each month no matter what the price is (~$1100/month). Dividends are re-invested

3) I have 1 year CDs worth 10k @4.5% 

4) 10k spare cash (in case of black swans) this will keep growing over time.

Thoughts/Questions:
1) I don’t expect interest rates to stay above 4% forever and hence I would need an alternative to t-bills. I will continue only until t-bills return more than 4%. What do you guys recommend?

2) I need to diversify into ETFs outside USA. What are the top global ETFs or ex-USA ETFs? 

3) Should I invest into Gold/Silver funds? Never thought of it as a long term investment. 

4) Are there any other less risky retirement type investments that you could do within a 401k?

The inflation has been so bad over the past couple years, that our 10-year annualized average has been 2.2358%.

In order to average a 2.0% inflation rate across 15 years (the previous 10 plus the next 5), we'd have to get inflation to an annualized 1.54% for the next 5 years. If we allowed ourselves the next decade to bring the 20-year average down, we'd need roughly 1.75% over the next 10 years.

1.54% annualized would require 0.12% MoM readings. 1.75% annualized would require under 0.15% MoM readings.

So, when people are talking about inflation is going back the other way, and time to turn on the money printers, keep this in mind. If the Fed really cared about 2.0% PCE inflation, we'd be really tight for a long time.

Lately I have been studying how the US stock market usually reacts to changes in the Fed Funds rate.  I cannot post the chart here, but there is an interesting ""Fed Funds rate vs S&amp;P500"" chart available here: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2638/sp500-fed-funds-rate-compared](https://www.macrotrends.net/2638/sp500-fed-funds-rate-compared).  Looking at the ""All Years"" chart (70-years), a few of my takeaways are:  

1. Recessions are not uncommon over the long term.  There have been 10 recessions in the past 70 years (the 2-month recession in Feb/Mar 2020 is hard to see on the 70-yr chart due to scale).
2. Recessions are usually relatively short-lived, ranging from a few months to 1.5 years.
3. Recessions generally occur during periods of Fed Fund rate reduction.
4. During most Fed rate increases in recent history (30 yrs), the S&amp;P500 generally increases, while during Fed rate reductions, the S&amp;P500 generally decreases.
5. The current situation does not seem to be following this trend.  The Fed rate has been increasing since Mar 2022, and the S&amp;P500 has been decreasing over much of that time.

Questions: Why is the current situation different?  Could it be due to the faster Fed Fund rate of increase?  I realize that the S&amp;P500 has been ""overbought / high P/E ratio"" the past few years; perhaps that's also a factor.  What other macro factors may be affecting it?

&gt;US bank lending contracted by the most on record in the last two weeks of March, indicating a tightening of credit conditions in the wake of several high-profile bank collapses that risks damaging the economy.

&gt;Commercial bank lending dropped nearly $105 billion in the two weeks ended March 29, the most in Federal Reserve data back to 1973. The more than $45 billion decrease in the latest week was primarily due to a a drop in loans by small banks.

&gt;The pullback in total lending in the last half of March was broad and included fewer real estate loans, as well as commercial and industrial loans.
US Bank Lending Drops Dramatically | Bank lending fell by a record $104.7 billion in the last two weeks of March
 
 
&gt;Friday’s report also showed commercial bank deposits dropped $64.7 billion in the latest week, marking the 10th-straight decrease that mainly reflected a decline at large firms.

&gt;The slide in lending follows the collapse of several firms including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

&gt;Economists are closely monitoring the Fed’s so-called H.8 report, which provides an estimated weekly aggregate balance sheet for all commercial banks in the US, to gauge credit conditions. The recent bank failures have complicated the central bank’s efforts to reduce inflation without sending the economy into a recession.

&gt;On Thursday, the American Bankers Association index of credit conditions fell to the lowest level since the onset of the pandemic, indicating bank economists see credit conditions weakening over the next six months. As a result, banks are likely to become more cautious about extending credit.

&gt;The banking crisis has made a recession more likely, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Jamie Dimon. The bank’s chief executive officer said in an annual letter that the failures have “provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more conservative.”

&gt;The Fed’s report showed that by bank size, lending decreased $23.5 billion at the 25 largest domestically chartered banks in the latest two weeks, and plunged $73.6 billion at smaller commercial banks over the same period. Lending by foreign institutions in the US fell $7.5 billion.

&gt;The biggest 25 domestic banks account for almost three-fifths of lending, although in some key areas — including commercial real estate — smaller banks are the most important providers of credit.

&gt;In a note on the report, the Fed said domestically chartered banks made divestments to nonbank institutions that affected $60 billion in loans in the week ended March 22, meaning those loans are no longer held by commercial lenders.

&gt;Meanwhile, so-called “other” deposits, which exclude large time deposits, have fallen $260.8 billion at commercial banks since the week ended March 15. At domestically chartered banks, they declined $236 billion, mostly reflecting a drop at the 25 largest institutions. Deposits at small banks fell $58.1 billion.

&gt;Two-Week Changes:

&gt;Commercial and industrial lending — considered a closely &gt;Commercial real estate loans dropped $35.3 billion
&gt;Total assets, which includes vault cash, as well as balances due from depository institutions and the Fed, decreased nearly $220 billion
&gt;Total liabilities declined more than $188 billion

t3_12ffq8h|1680942189|investing|Has the Time to Buy Bonds Finally Arrived? [Discussion]|"**For context, I am based in the UK and I'm 27 so I'm looking at this through a long-term lens.**

I started seriously investing in mid-2019 and since then, I've always thought that bonds did not really offer that good of a risk/reward ratio. Obviously, bonds skyrocketed in 2020 once interest rates were cut down since price obviously moves opposite to yield. We saw possibly the most expensive bonds ever in the UK, US and EU.

Since then, I've actively avoided bonds and only had a veeery tiny exposure for monitoring purposes. However, now, it seems that we may be hitting the bottom for bond prices. The Federal Reserve have signaled they will most likely avoid raising rates further or, at most, do another couple of raises of up to 6% at the most (even that may be unlikely given the banking situation). The Bank of England is in a slightly different situation, but I imagine they won't be raising rates that much higher either as things will simply start breaking.

My point here is this: bonds are starting to offer returns comparable to stocks (in my eyes). Up until now, my investment allocation in my ISA (*for those not in the UK, this is basically an investment vehicle which allows you to invest up to £20,000 every year tax-free, e.g. capital gains and dividends received there are not taxable*) is around 90% stocks, 7% gold and 3% bonds. I use Moneybox (a passive investing ISA app) so the 2 bond funds (both are denominated in GBP, too) available to me are:

* [iShares Overseas Government Bonds](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B849C803-ishares-overseas-govt-bnd-index-d-acc/key-statistics)
* [iShares Overseas Corporate ESG Bonds](https://www.fidelity.co.uk/factsheet-data/factsheet/GB00B58YKH53-ishares-esg-overseas-corp-bd-index-d-acc/key-statistics)

I'm considering putting 20-25% of all my **future contributions** (I won't be selling any existing positions) to these bonds with 15% to government and 5-10% to corporate bonds. The way I see it is that if we're approaching the end of the rate hike cycle for the Fed/BoE/ECB, then prices of bonds will soon start to rise and, even if they don't, then the yield will still be good enough to keep them around. Plus, the longer rates stay higher, the bigger dividend these funds will start paying as they will be able to buy/replace more notes/bonds with higher coupon rates.

Obviously, sticky inflation and other issues can change that. There is also talk of potential debt defaults and all that - we've seen the bank problems recently, but I don't know how much of this is FUD and how much is really possible. To me, the default risk is really the highest which is why I want to buy more government bonds since I don't think they will default - they may print more money and increase inflation, but the default is off the table (in my eyes).

What are your thoughts on bonds right now? Is it worth buying \[more of\] them? Am I missing something really obvious here?"|0.76|24|0|24

They are nearing retirement (~10yrs away). I recommended they reach out to a financial advisor to determine how best to utilize their remaining balance. Given their lower risk appetite the advisor recommended reinvesting in VOO and just letting the 70k sit and grow over time. Our friend has a 401k thankfully but still thinks a more active approach is best. I’ve also recommended that they invest in VOO and step away from trying to beat the market. What are your thoughts for this strategy? Is it wishful thinking to presume they could recover their losses over the next 5-10 yrs via an ETF?


Edit: 
I’d like to thank you all for your thoughtful responses. I shared this post and the other in /stocks with him and he’s decided to finally listen. Next steps is interviewing a couple more fee only financial advisors (that are fiduciaries) and he’s agreed to stop and let them handle his portfolio moving forward. For those asking about retirement, he has a 401k that has roughly ~600k in it but this loss in particular was tough because it was his “liquid savings” outside of a modest emergency fund. Given the plan to retire in 10 years, he recognizes the damage and is going to work with an advisor to build a realistic investment strategy to maximize returns in the interim."|0.81|111|0|111

&gt;When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month, the core problem was a giant hole in its bond portfolio. When depositors started fleeing First Republic Bank pointing triangle soon afterward, the concern mainly was about a hole in its loan book.

&gt;Nearly every publicly traded bank in the country is sitting on loans that have declined in value since they were made. The culprit is rising interest rates, which also slashed the value of banks’ other big asset, their holdings of securities. 

&gt;The overall market-value losses on securities are well known because they are tallied up industrywide by banking regulators. The scale of market-value losses on loans made by publicly traded banks has to be tallied from banks’ securities filings.

&gt;“Fair values of loans and securities are not qualitatively different,” said Tom Linsmeier, an accounting professor at the University of Wisconsin and former member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. “They measure the same amount: the price at which the asset can be sold in an orderly transaction in the market today.”

&gt;**First Republic’s balance sheet showed $166.1 billion of loans as of Dec. 31, at amortized cost. A footnote said their fair-market value was $143.9 billion. The $22.2 billion difference was greater than First Republic’s $17.4 billion of total equity, or assets minus liabilities.**

&gt;The bank was seen by investors as risky because most of its loans at year-end were home mortgages with fixed or hybrid rates, meaning their low rates would stay fixed for one to 10 years. It also had $4.8 billion in unrealized losses on bonds. About 68% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end, meaning they exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. limits, which created greater flight risk. In that respect, it was similar to Silicon Valley Bank, which estimated that 88% of its deposits were uninsured. 

&gt;First Republic bought itself time last month after a group of 11 banks led by JPMorgan Chase deposited $30 billion to halt the run. While the deposits helped liquidity, they didn’t boost First Republic’s capital. A First Republic spokesman declined to comment.

&gt;While First Republic is an extreme example, it isn’t alone. Among 435 publicly traded U.S. banks listed on major exchanges, 97% of them reported that their loans’ market value was less than their balance-sheet amount as of Dec. 31, according to data provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

&gt;Combined, they had $242 billion of unrealized losses on their loans, defined as the difference between the loans’ fair values and carrying amounts. That was equivalent to 14% of their total equity and 21% of their tangible common equity, which is a widely used measure of net worth that excludes preferred stock and intangible assets.

&gt;A year earlier, the same banks said their loans’ fair value exceeded their carrying amount by $96 billion, the data show. The same group showed $299 billion of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities as of Dec. 31. Those losses aren’t included on companies’ balance sheets.

&gt;The unrealized losses on loans and securities likely fell at many banks in recent weeks as Treasury yields declined. The lower yields signal that investors think the economy is slowing. If they are right, then borrowers could start to fall behind on their loans, adding to losses on bank balance sheets.

&gt;Banks reporting large fair-value discounts on their loans could face earnings or liquidity pressure. They could face pressure to pay higher rates for deposits and other funding sources, while yields on fixed-rate loans they own stay low. “If liquidity issues arise for these banks, they may need either to issue additional debt capital at higher interest rates or to sell those loans to become more liquid,” Mr. Linsmeier said.

&gt;**The 435 banks in The Wall Street Journal’s sample included 100 where the combined unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities were equivalent to 50% or more of their total equity.**

&gt;**Bank of Hawaii Corp. in its most recent annual report said it had $985 million of unrealized losses on loans and $799 million of unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities, as of Dec. 31. The combined $1.8 billion total exceeded Bank of Hawaii’s $1.3 billion of total equity. The company estimated that 52% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end. A Bank of Hawaii spokeswoman declined to comment.**

&gt;**Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp. reported $3.9 billion and $177 million of unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities, respectively, as of Dec. 31. By comparison, the company had $5.4 billion of total equity. Western Alliance estimated that 55% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end.**

&gt;**Western Alliance this week filed disclosures showing updated fair-value and deposit figures. Unrealized losses for loans and held-to-maturity securities had declined to $2.9 billion and $139 million, respectively, as of March 31. Deposits were $47.6 billion, down 11% since Dec. 31, while the uninsured-deposit ratio fell to 32%.**

&gt;Dale Gibbons, Western Alliance’s chief financial officer, in an email said, “Western Alliance has access to significant liquidity from a variety of sources, including pledging loans to secure credit facilities, which mitigates need to sell assets and realize adverse asset marks.” He said the company doesn’t need to raise capital.

&gt;**CVB Financial Corp., based in Ontario, Calif., reported $919 million and $399 million of unrealized losses on loans and held-to-maturity securities, respectively, as of Dec. 31. Combined, those were equivalent to 68% of its total equity, and they exceeded its tangible common equity. CVB estimated 65% of its deposits were uninsured at year-end.**

&gt;CVB’s chief executive officer, David Brager, said the bank’s deposit relationships remain strong and often span decades. “We haven’t had significant relationships that have expressed concern,” he said. He noted the bank has grown slowly and doesn’t have any large industry concentrations comparable to Silicon Valley Bank’s tech-heavy focus.

&gt;CVB’s chief financial officer, Allen Nicholson, said “most likely those unrealized losses have diminished somewhat” since year-end, because rates declined.

&gt;Systemically important banks have an advantage over smaller banks, because they are widely perceived as too big to fail and implicitly backed by the government. Consequently, they may continue to attract low-cost deposits and retain uninsured deposits at the expense of smaller competitors, even if their disclosures show they have large capital holes on a fair-value basis."|0.95|528|0|528
t3_12ehpy6|1680866019|investing|Questions about internal taxation of ETFs|"Hello fellow investors. I've been wondering:

When an ETF receives dividends/coupons from the underlying companies or bonds, does the ETF itself pay withholding tax? 

When an ETF buys and sells assets, does the ETF itself pay any tax on profits? 

These may be important considerations, since as investors we are liable to taxation when receiving dividends or selling our ETFs at a profit. As such if the ETF itself paid taxes, then we would suffer double-taxation - in this case it would be more tax-efficient to own shares directly.

It would obviously then be in a taxable account, and you would be unable to put back in anything but the annual limit from here on.

I realize I can run a 30 year calculator on just that amount at 4-5% to see what the ROTH would do, but there are questions of immediate value of having the money available in my 40s and 50s, and of course there's the chance it does better or worse in other investments.

Just curious to see the sub's number-- what % would sway you one way or the other."|0.46|0|0|0

A few months ago I saw some goldbug types tweeting (what I thought were) interesting numbers regarding central banks gold reserves over the years. This was after Russia attacked and the war had started. The US went to work fucking Russia's life up as best they could (not a political statement) and the rest of the world seemed to react to this display of power from the US kinda like ""oh shit, they can just freeze our reserves"" or so the narrative along with the posts went. 

A January article:
&gt;Central banks added a whopping 1,136 tonnes of gold worth some $70 billion to their stockpiles in 2022, by far the most of any year in records going back to 1950, the World Gold Council (WGC) said on Tuesday.

&gt;The data underline a shift in attitudes to gold since the 1990s and 2000s, when central banks, particularly those in Western Europe that own a lot of bullion, sold hundreds of tonnes a year.

~ https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/central-banks-bought-most-gold-since-1967-last-year-wgc-says-2023-01-31/

A gold bug dude Ronnie Stoeferle tweeted this report which had a detailed history of how the dollar came to be reserve currency and why this sucks for everyone else: https://ingoldwetrust.report/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/In-Gold-We-Trust-report-2022-english.pdf


There's talk of the BRICS maybe doing something but that suddenly explodes with news stories kinda coming out at an accelerating pace regarding trade in yuan etc.

Lots of twitter accounts posting things like ""The dollar isn't losing itsposition as reserve currency, gtfo you idiots"" and there seems to be a dismissal of some facts here where literal history is made when trade is setttled in non dollars.



So before you pick a side of this whole story get some extra information on why each side is saying what they're saying. Personally don't think the dollar is going anywhere for many years but I do think change is happening in that way where, you'd look back and say it happened slowly and then all at once.

That change could just be a decline in % of world trade to half. It could be anything. The BRICS guys need to be careful about handing China the same power the USA has with their currency but it looks like China is playing them all really well. 

But please do remember the USA is indeed in a position of exorbitant privilege when disucssing, I hate when there's ignorance of historical context in these discussions.

But my bigger question is that when Trinity Capital (ticker TRIN) IPO'd, they announced an IPO price of $14 at 8.5 million shares ([https://ir.trinitycap.com/news-releases/news-release-details/trinity-capital-inc-announces-closing-initial-public-offering](https://ir.trinitycap.com/news-releases/news-release-details/trinity-capital-inc-announces-closing-initial-public-offering)).

t3_12cxh0s|1680727936|investing|Withdraw Roth principal for investment with return guaranteed|"EDIT: I really do appreciate the replies, and like I said I'd be first in line to give the warning to others. I chose the word ""investment"" because I wanted it to be relevant to the sub-- I realize it was poorly (and sketchily worded).

 I would liken it more to ""do you want this rental property owned 100% by the family member, that is paid for, has it's upkeep already covered, and you get the rent checks. Someone else will select the renters and deal with collecting, if it's empty you still get the rent checks, and there are no gotchas or hidden terms. Write the contract yourself if you want.

I apologize for wasting your times-- I worded the questions wrong: **What I should have asked is: in your mid 30s, at what % gain is it worth taking out the first 10 years of ROTH contributions, knowing you'll still only be able to put them back in at the annual limit from here on?**

&amp;#x200B;

OP: Ok, I have a strange opportunity: been maxing my wife and I's (mid-30s) ROTHs for about 12 years now. Give or take about $120k in contributions between the two, they've done well and are worth about double that.

I was offered an ""investment"" opportunity by a family member, with a guarantee of 25% annually on my money put in. If it does more than that, great, I get that too, but the 25% number is the floor.

Now listen, if I read this on here I would immediately respond ""Scam, ponzi, don't trust family"" etc, but without going into details this is more of a ""Family member would like to gift us this amount, but wants us to have a viable interest."" As in, the 25% is literally cash already sitting in an account in only my name each year ahead of time.

So knowing this--- is it worth pulling the $120k principal? These are obviously years I cannot put back into the ROTHs, and my worry is I'm killing my compound interest 20-30 years down the road. This opportunity will probably last for about 3-5 years, so I would gain about $70k-$90k (taxable) in that time frame.

I guess my question, in your opinion, is that extra gain now worth losing the contributions inside the ROTH?"|0.25|0|0|0

t3_12cuzf4|1680722572|investing|China’s Insatiable Demand for Gold Explained|"China's appetite for gold continues to grow. In 2022, China was the world’s largest gold producer. In addition, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) continues to add gold to its reserves, taking the total central bank gold reserves to 2,050t at the end of February 2023.

The country's massive gold stash suggests we could be on the cusp of a radical change in the global monetary system.

Renowned speculator Nick Giambruno points to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to launch ""a new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation.""

GCC states — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates — account for over 25% of global oil exports. China is the GCC’s largest trading partner, with over 25% of its oil imports from Saudi Arabia. Hence, the meetings reflect a growing trade relationship between China, the world’s largest oil importer, and the GCC, the world’s largest oil exporters.

During Xi’s visit, he said, ""China will continue to import large quantities of crude oil from GCC countries, expand imports of liquefied natural gas, and use **the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) as a platform to carry out yuan settlement of oil and gas trade**."" For context, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) launched a crude oil futures contract denominated in Chinese yuan in March 2018. [The contract is based on Brent crude oil, the global benchmark for oil prices, and allows oil producers to sell their oil for Chinese yuan instead of the U.S. dollar.](https://www.ine.cn/en/products/sc/)

By trading in yuan, the INE oil futures contract is expected to reduce the reliance on the U.S. dollar while increasing the use of the Chinese yuan in global trade.

Nick Giambruno notes that **“most oil producers don’t want to pile up a large yuan reserve.” This is where China’s massive gold stash comes in**.

**They’ve linked the crude futures contract with the ability to convert yuan into physical gold through exchanges in Shanghai and Hong Kong**. Moreso, PetroChina and Sinopec, two Chinese oil firms, provide liquidity to the yuan crude futures. So, there'll be a bid if oil producers want to sell for yuan and gold.

For example, lets look at Silgan Containers.  They are the largest food can packaging manufacturer in the US, and a solid company.  Their PE is 17, which is actually quite high I would think.  The stock growth has been great for the last 5 years, which makes their paltry 1.3% dividend not an issue.  But now with MMFs and CDs offering ~5%, what makes investors want to keep pumping money into this stock?  Are they doing share buybacks to pump the stock price instead of issuing dividends?  

Some companies like MO, who have a much much more grim future outlook in terms of growth(I would say the market, rightfully so, sees their revenue severely declining) offer high dividends, ie: ~8%, but most people don't expect their SP to go up.  In fact, I think most investors in it expect the best case scenario would be for it to remain flat...but the high dividend would be worth it there."|0.63|3|0|3

&gt;Jamie Dimon has criticised regulators in the wake of the banking turmoil for incentivising banks to load up on government securities and imposing flawed stress tests.

&gt;Dimon said the failure last month of Silicon Valley Bank and the Swiss government-engineered takeover of Credit Suisse risked undermining confidence in the banking industry and had prompted investors to price in a greater risk of a US recession.

&gt;In his annual shareholder letter, the JPMorgan Chase boss said rules had encouraged banks to amass large portfolios of US Treasury bonds that dropped in value as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, leaving lenders nursing paper losses that have spooked investors.

&gt;“Ironically, banks were incented to own very safe government securities because they were considered highly liquid by regulators and carried very low capital requirements,” he wrote in the letter, published on Tuesday.

&gt;The decision by SVB to invest its deposits in longer dated Treasuries damaged confidence in the lender and ultimately led to a bank run. 

&gt;Dimon also took aim at US stress tests, the annual exercises run by the Fed to gauge the biggest banks’ ability to withstand major economic shocks. He said the exercise had become “an enormous, mind-numbingly complex task about crossing t’s and dotting i’s” that might give risk committees a false sense of security.

&gt;“Even worse, the stress testing based on the scenario devised by the Federal Reserve Board . . . never incorporated interest rates at higher levels,” he added.

&gt;“A less academic, more collaborative reflection of possible risks that a bank faces would better inform institutions and their regulators about the full landscape of potential risks,” he said.

&gt;His comments on the banking turmoil reflect the growing belief among executives that the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank, two of the largest bank failures in US history, will lead to a toughening up of regulations.

&gt;SVB was not subject to some of the Fed’s toughest supervisory measures, including regular stress tests, because it had fewer than $250bn in assets. 

&gt;Dimon urged policymakers to avoid “knee-jerk, whack-a-mole or politically motivated responses”.

&gt;“We should not aim for a regulatory regime that eliminates all failure but one that reduces the chance of failure and the odds of contagion,” wrote Dimon, who has in the past complained that regulatory requirements disincentivise banks out of some activities such as mortgage lending.

&gt;He added: “We should carefully study why this particular situation happened but not overreact.”

&gt;Dimon, 67, is one of the banking industry’s elder statesmen. He uses his annual letter to opine on topics beyond his own institution, making it one of the most widely read missives on Wall Street.

&gt;He warned that JPMorgan, the largest US bank with more than $2tn in assets, was “prepared for potentially higher interest rates, and we may have higher inflation for longer”.

&gt;Higher rates will result in pain for any borrowers who have to refinance their loans, which Dimon said could expose additional weaknesses in the US economy, including in the areas of the property market.

&gt;Dimon also touched on JPMorgan’s succession planning, a perennial debate swirling around the lender given that he has led the bank since 2006.

&gt;Dimon said the bank had “multiple successor candidates who are well known to the board and to the investor community”. In 2021, JPMorgan made a series of executive changes seen as preparing potential successors to Dimon, who has the backing from JPMorgan’s board to remain in the job for several more years."|0.82|508|0|508

You can focus better, your eyes won't get irritated, you have physical proof of your progress and much more. Companies used to be legally obliged to send investors real copies of these reports, but with the rise of the internet, they only have to make an online version available. This is certainly useful for archiving reports, but not for reading current ones. I do know of a website (prars) that supplements free hard copies of reports, but they only have a few companies listed with real copies. The less conventional way is sending a quick email to investor relations explaining that you are a potential or current investor and want a hard copy (don't forget to leave your address).

The fund is about 50% lent out and a huge portion of the collateral is US equities. 

The collateralization ratio is at around 110%.

I'm not an expert, but it feels like a bad idea to secure a low risk asset with a high risk collateral. Especially for a 0.03% return that barely puts a dent in the 0.1% TER.

Also, what kind of trader borrows government bonds?

2021: Total assets fell 51% and did not grow in 2022.

2021: Goodwill net dropped from $8,450 to $2,585

2021: Large reductions in PPE likely due to Covid and WFH

Prop/Plant/Equip - Gross fell 44% yoy.
Prop/Plant/Equip - net fell 58% yov.

Then in the last half of 2022 the balance sheet shows a large Goodwill increase from $2,861 to $10,126 and stays there till the end of the year. This amount is more than the historical high in 2020 @ $8,450.

This change represents a significant increase in total assets for 2022YE and keeping the Asset liability ratio close to 1. 

Then if I strip out goodwill, their asset to liability coverage drops to .51 and .58 for 2021 &amp; 2022, and only improves in 2022YE due to the large Goodwill infusion

Thoughts on this? Am I missing something that would make this attractive to hold right now? Curious if anyone has some holes to poke into this or advice on some other places to look for why goodwill had such a drastic change, for what I think is a bit of a nebulous entry."|0.33|0|0|0

t3_12bmd47|1680621782|investing|Why Warren Buffett Bought More $OXY?|"Buffett has been buying Occidental Petroleum (OXY) stock. As of March 2023, Berkshire Hathaway owns 23% of OXY, making it the company's largest shareholder.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation is an American multinational petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company. Occidental's principal businesses consist of three segments: oil and gas, chemical, and marketing and midstream. 

OXY's stock has been on a tear in recent months, up more than 50% year-to-date. The company's stock is currently trading at around $65 per share, near its all-time high.

Here are some of the reasons why Warren Buffett may have been attracted to OXY:

Investment opportunity: Buffett is known for seeking out good investment opportunities. OXY may have appeared attractive to him due to its strong cash flow, diversified assets, and the potential for growth. OXY is a cyclical business. This means that the company's stock price is likely to go up and down with the price of oil. Buffett may believe that the price of oil is likely to go up in the future, which would boost OXY's stock price. OXY is a good fit for Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy, they invests in companies that Buffett believes are well-run and have a strong competitive advantage. OXY fits this criteria, as it is a leading oil and gas company with a strong track record.

Favorable valuation: OXY stock may have been undervalued at the time of purchase, which would have made it a good investment opportunity for Buffett.

Attractive dividend yield: At the time of purchase, OXY had a high dividend yield, which would have been attractive to Buffett, who favors companies that pay steady dividends.

Bulls

1. There are a few reasons for OXY's stock surge. The company has benefited from the recent rebound in oil prices. Oil prices have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, and they are currently trading at around $110 per barrel. This has boosted OXY's earnings and cash flow.

2. OXY has been making progress in its debt reduction efforts. The company has reduced its debt by more than $10 billion since the beginning of the year. This has improved OXY's financial position and made it more attractive to investors.

3. OXY has been investing in new growth projects. The company is spending billions of dollars on new oil and gas projects in the Permian Basin and other areas. These projects are expected to boost OXY's production and earnings in the coming years.

Bears

1.  Debt: OXY has a significant amount of debt, which could be a risk if interest rates rise.

2.  Volatility: The energy industry can be highly volatile due to factors such as changes in global demand, geopolitical events, and fluctuations in commodity prices. OXY's stock price is sensitive to changes in oil prices. If oil prices decline, OXY's earnings and cash flow could be negatively impacted.

3.  Environmental concerns: The shift towards renewable energy sources and increasing regulations on emissions can negatively impact OXY's operations and profitability.

4.  Competition: OXY faces intense competition from other major players in the industry, which can affect its market share and pricing power.

Overall, OXY is a well-run company with a strong track record. The company is benefiting from the recent rebound in oil prices, and it is making progress in its debt reduction efforts. OXY is also investing in new growth projects that are expected to boost its production and earnings in the coming years."|0.71|9|0|9

I am slowing starting to build an investment portfolio based mostly on the Boglehead strategy but am discouraged by current account size &amp; late start.

Key facts:
- 33m, married
- 90k€ salary, wife currently not working due to new baby but will start back in Aug. at around 50k€
- located in Germany so no 401k options, I plan to max out roth IRA contributions starting this year though (I am a US citizen, wife is German.
- current account. size ca. 10k€
- monthly contributions 1,380€

Although we are getting a late start on our portfolio, we are on track to pay off our mortgage in the next 4 years. House will have an equity value of around 250k€.

We also started buying investment properties in the area in the past few years. Currently, across all properties, we are paying down about 600€/month on the principle of the mortgages. The area is relatively stable as far as property prices are concerned, we are not speculating on major appreciation but rather on building equity and either selling before retirement or keeping for monthly income (ca. 2.700€/month after mortgage is paid and accounting for maintenance/repair cash reserves &amp; admin. costs)

How should I best include the real estate component in our retirement planning? I want to be realistic and conservative but would like to include in our planning so as to not feel so overwhelmed when looking at how far behind our retirement savings portfolio is.

t3_12az2xb|1680558477|investing|Am I calculating the return on this bond correctly?|"Hello, I'm not sure if I'm calculating the return on this bond correctly, wanted to make sure I'm doing my math right.
CUSIP: 91282CBV2
Ask price: 95.773
Matures: 4/15/2024
Coupon: 0.375%

So if I buy 73 of these at the rate above, my cost basis would be $69,914.29.
The coupon pays out 0.375% per bond I own, semi-annually. So when this bond matures, that will be (1000*0.00375)*73 * 2 = (face value * coupon)*numBonds * numPayments = $547.50

Then when the bonds mature I'll get $73,000.

So profit is: 73000 - 69914.29 + $547.50 = $3,633.21

Interest for the one year I'm holding it is 3633.21 / 69914.29 = 0.0519666 = 5.196%

Is this correct? Or is the coupon rate actually 0.1875%, and the 0.375% is actually the annual rate but it is paid out semi-annually?"|0.64|3|0|3

      * Easy to get through your brokerage account via auction
      * Due to short term nature of the investment and the govt backing, there is little to no risk of capital depreciation.
Apparently liquid on the secondary market though I haven't figured out how to execute a sale of a till I bought at auction. Anyone know how to do it on TD Ameritrade?
   * Cons
      * Lower yields
   * Questions
      * If you want to actually own the bills rather than a fund or ETF, is there any way to do it besides at auction? Is there a secondary market for T-bills?


&amp;#x200B;

**Money Market Funds**

*  These are funds created by brokers (ex SWVXX -  Schwab Value Advantage Money Fund). The MM funds tend to end tickers with XX. 
   * Pros
      * Market yields can be close to that of CDs and treasuries
      * Easy to acquire through a brokerage account. Same as buying a mutual fund.
      * Liquid - You can buy or close position at the end of every trading day.
   *  Cons
      * There is market and interest rate risk. Although the funds tend to be invested by the fund manager in low risk securities, there is still risk of loss.
      * Not protected by FDIC or SPIC.
   * Questions
      * Dividends are paid out periodically (monthly), so if you sell say 15 days after a dividend payment date, do you still get half a month's yield? Is return prorated like that?

&amp;#x200B;

**ETFs**

* There are ETFs like TBIL and SGOV that give investors exposure to govt debt in an ETF form.
   * Pros
      * Easy to buy and sell. Can do so at any time during market hours.
      * Liquid - can get in and out of position with ease.
   * Cons
      * The ETFs can lose market value.
      * Yields (at least from what I have seen) are a bit lower than those of the underlying assets. Purely anecdotal, though.

&amp;#x200B;

**CDs**

*  Financial institutions borrow money for short to intermediate terms from investors. Yields are based on duration, market interest rates and expectation of future rates, as well as credit rating of borrowers.
   * Pros
      * Yields tend to be higher than treasuries and MM funds.
      * Easy to acquire on most brokerage accounts. 
      * Default risk is mitigated (up to certain limits) by the FDIC.
   * Cons
      * less liquid- Once you lend the money it is gone until the end of the agreed upon period. This locks your capital into a fixed rate of return. Thus ,if interest rates increase or there are buying opportunities in the market, that capital is tied up. So opportunity costs can be potentially high unless you are able to sell on the secondary market which is not as simple as trading other securities. 
      * There is default risk if your CDs exceed amounts  covered by the FDIC. Generally easy to avoid if you stay under $250k and spread out between accounts."|0.43|0|0|0

t3_1290ju9|1680386907|investing|Suggestions/feedbacks on possible long-term portfolios|"&gt;This is a long text, but my goal was to describe everything that went through my head over the last few months while studying about ETF and investment strategies for the long term.

# Introduction

I'm Brazilian and the investment culture here is not as strong as it is in the United States. Studying about investments was when I found out about ETFs and since then I haven't thought about investing in any other way.

My main goal: **retirement**. In 20\~30 years time (I'm currently 27) to live on income. So far, nothing new. My secondary objective: I am (relatively) young and I am willing to expose myself to greater risks for the benefit of an also greater profit, so in my investments I also seek to **leverage my equity**.

# Development

*""VT and chill""* \- along with the expression, the first ETF I met. It surprised me a lot. *How could I INVEST IN THE WHOLE WORLD with just one share?* And in an intelligent way, following criteria of weights in the economy, etc. Very effective, very easy.

But... I want more. More profitability. Throughout the post I will mention some characteristics that I intend to follow and the first is: I do not see the need to invest in emerging countries. In fact, **I don't see the need to invest in any country other than the United States**. And here I know that I am beginning to contradict a large part of the community because no one is able to say that this hegemony will last forever. History shows us that this leadership is cyclical. I just believe that when this game turns around, I might not be here anymore.

&gt;I also really like [this video by Professor G (watch minute 5:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K9BbRVOioE). In short, a huge portion of American companies are multinationals with stakes in the economy around the world.

So here we are. US ETFs. And of course the VT brothers were the next to introduce themselves to me, **VOO** and **VTI**. But which one to choose? Well, I've already done my homework researching the dozens of posts that exist around here ([especially this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/wj6k23/vti_or_voo/)) and I can already say that it makes no practical difference. Of all the ETFs I've ever researched and studied, the one that I was immediately sure of ""this is it"" was VOO, **so I'm sure it will be in my portfolio**.

I could stop there. *""VOO and chill""*. Even searching around here I could see [how popular this strategy is](https://i.imgur.com/ryoJOA2.png). And there's no questioning it, after all, nothing is simpler than a 1-fund portfolio. But I think it would be fun (and financially interesting) to play around a bit more here. So here begins my quest to build an ETF portfolio that:

1. Be simple (*5 funds max*);
2. Be safe (*primary objective*);
3. Be able to leverage my equity (*secondary objective*);

Let's talk about dividends? Here in Brazil, it is quite common for investors to focus their assets with the aim of optimizing this passive income. The biggest investor here (*our ""Warren Buffet""*) [revealed that he received around R$1 million PER DAY in dividends](https://www.suno.com.br/noticias/luiz-barsi-ganha-dividendos-dia/). Dividends are incredible. The fact that you can live off your equity without having to liquidate it is fantastic.

&gt;I've read a lot about the discussion that exists on top of dividends ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/d08rev/why_im_not_a_dividend_investor/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1svrf7/why_in_my_opinion_investors_should_hate_dividends/), among others...). About the profit made being automatically deducted from the share value and in the end, you won nothing. But I know that in practice it is different and that the growth of your passive income ends up being a motivation to continue with constant contributions.

And it was in the specific sub of this wonder, r/dividends that I found the next (and very famous) ETF, **SCHD**. I imagine it needs no introduction. It's funny how this ETF is treated like a king in that sub. And, similarly to VOO, the more I learned about this fund, the more certain I was that it would be part of my portfolio.

And here I started to question myself about the distribution of these two funds. 100% VOO, [100% SCHD,](https://i.imgur.com/f3ThptT.png) 50/50. There are many possibilities. I know I don't need the dividends right now. And that a strategy that I found very interesting is to focus on leveraging your equity to liquidate these positions in the future and exchange them for dividend shares. That would be one reason why I wouldn't invest in SCHD right now if that fund didn't have a wonderful upside performance.

I started looking into **growth ETFs**. Since I figured ""*I'm not running the risk I'm willing to take*"" with these two other funds that in my opinion are ""safe"". VOO = Top 500 Companies, [SCHD = A Value Fund](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/sth64m/could_schd_also_act_as_a_value_etf/). For this category I will name 3 ETFs that I find interesting and that are the most popular when I research them: **SCHG**, **VUG** and **QQQ**.

I really like the first two because of the **minimal overlap with SCHD**. I see this feature as important because I want to diversify as much as possible with as little funds as possible. QQQ performed better compared to its ""competitors"", but should it be here on this list? I say this because it is not really a ""growth ETF"" and simply replicates the 100 NASDAQ-listed stocks index.

&gt;I've studied other ETFs that fit this category as well like VONG and MGK. I'm not 100% sure which ETF I should buy if I wanted to add that kind of exposure to my portfolio.

On the other side of the ring, technology ETFs. I really love these as they focus exclusively on the sector I'm most interested in. **VGT** and **FTEC** appear to me and I start questioning which asset class to use for the ""risk"" side of my portfolio. Large Cap Growth are more diversified, but I truly believe that the technology sector is the world's guide to the future.

And it's in this paragraph that I'm going to start questioning the last 3. Researching (which is what I've been doing most) I came across several discussions about ""Small Caps Value vs. Large Cap Growth"" and how this first category has historically delivered greater result. One of the most enlightening contents was this text: ""[Why Does Small Value Do Well?](http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/index_funds/why_sv.htm)"" and this Ben Felix video: ""[Small Cap and Value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MVSsVi1_e4)"".

I came to the conclusion that investing in growth factor is not the best decision to make when looking at historical data. And it becomes even worse if you choose small stocks. And that, following these studies, the order (from worst to best) asset classes to invest in would be:

1. Small Caps Growth;
2. Large Caps Growth;
3. Large Caps Value;
4. Small Values Value;

So, based on that, I realize that adding this category to my portfolio would be an interesting way to adjust my ""risk x return"". Some ETFs I've studied that seem to be quite popular in this category are **AVUV** and **VBR**, the former being ""actively managed"" so it's expected that the chosen assets will be of higher quality (but at the cost of a higher expense ratio, 0.25%) .

# Conclusion

As mentioned I know my exposure must vary over the decades. The risk/volatility I'm willing to take for now won't be interesting when I'm close to retirement. So, following the classes/assets I mentioned, I arrived at the following provisions: [**image link**](https://i.imgur.com/EVlT69l.png).

Gradually (over 20, 30 years) these readjustments would be made. For me the assets to represent the ""core"" and ""value"" class are VOO and SCHD respectively.

Finally, I conclude this huge text by thanking you for reading this far and asking for sincere feedback on what I mentioned. I am also very open to opinions/suggestions regarding the layout of my portfolio.

Thanks!"|0.65|5|0|5

I (age 31, from the Netherlands) recently started investing using ETFs via broker DeGIRO.

t3_127y5rj|1680294555|investing|ChatGPT: The Future of Investment Analysis? Our Experiment and Results|"We've been exploring AI language models like ChatGPT for investment analysis and thought we'd share our findings. Our team was curious to see how ChatGPT would perform against our model ensemble, so we put it to the test!

**Experiment Setup**

We designed a prompt to have ChatGPT generate financial analysis with a grade score and a confidence level from 0 to 1. After some prompt engineering, we got the desired output format. We then extracted the grade and confidence score using regex.

Here's an example of ChatGPT's outputs:

Grade: B. Confidence: 0.8. Market Axess Holdings Inc. has a robust business model, boasting a leading electronic trading platform in fixed-income markets. The company consistently pays dividends and has authorized multiple share repurchase programs. However, the lack of intrinsic value metrics, such as free cash flow yield and profit margin, prevents a higher grade.

**Evaluation Framework**

We integrated ChatGPT into our evaluation framework, which utilizes a train/validation/test structure, crucial for machine learning with price as a label by quintiles. This method ensures reliable model performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting. We discovered that ChatGPT's performance depends heavily on one critical parameter – the temperature, which influences output randomness.

In our case, we used data from approximately 500 companies, with 450 texts for training, 50 for validation, and 50 for testing. We trained our model using the 450 samples, evaluated and tuned the model with the validation set, and assessed the model's performance using the 50-sample test set. This approach minimizes overfitting and offers a dependable estimation of the model's performance on new, unseen data. For our in-house product-level model, we've optimized and frozen the model hyperparameters, using the validation set only for model selection. In our comparison, we evaluated the test set performance of our model against GPT-3.5 Turbo.

**Discussion**

Here is the figure summarizing the results [https://github.com/leotam/leotam.github.io/blob/master/assets/stdMar-29temp.jpg](https://github.com/leotam/leotam.github.io/blob/master/assets/stdMar-29temp.jpg). On the horizontal we have increasing temperature from 0 to 1, meaning more randomness and possibly creativity at higher ends. On the vertical, we have the MCC and accuracy. We can see that they have a rough correlation- a higher MCC will naturally have a higher accuracy. We'd expect a MCC of 0 to be equivalent to random chance which would imply an accuracy of 20% for quintiles. On the chart we can find the best GPT temperature setting was 0.6 which gave 25% accuracy or 5% above random chance. The corresponding MCC value was 0.026.  We can compare one of our strong model ensemble at 39.1% accuracy or 57% greater accuracy than the best GPT model.

It's important to note that we were limited to 4097 tokens for the GPT 3.5 turbo model (a close cousin of ChatGPT), while our models read up to the required 200k tokens per company. We also didn't use the more advanced GPT-4, which supports longer context up to 32k tokens, but at a much higher inference cost and time. GPT has a natural user interaction, and RLHF has an even more enticing prospect.

We found that ChatGPT has the potential to be a useful tool for investment analysis, but its performance can vary depending on the temperature parameter.

Still, their finances could be squeezed for years to come.|"From bloomberg, there is excellent graphics in the article I would recommend viewing: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-svb-exposed-risks-banks/?srnd=premium#xj4y7vzkg

&gt;The investment losses that helped take down Silicon Valley Bank are a problem, to one degree or another, across the US financial system. In total, the industry ended last year with $620 billion of unrealized losses on its books from investments in low-yielding bonds.

&gt;For most banks, the issue is manageable.

&gt;Bonds held in investment books represented less than a quarter of the banking system’s $23.6 trillion of assets in December, and unlike SVB, lenders usually have a wide array of depositors who are unlikely to all need money around the same time. For the biggest banks, the risks are even smaller. They are perceived as too big to fail. What’s more, the recent rally in the Treasury bond market — sparked, ironically, by the jitters about the health of the banking industry — is helping to shrink the $620 billion of paper losses. (In the coming weeks, banks will start to post first-quarter data.)
Banks’ Equity Could Take Hit If Paper Losses Had to Be Realized
For most banks, unrealized losses are a manageable problem. But investors and depositors remain jittery about lenders sitting on huge piles of money-losing bonds

&gt;And yet as depositors keep gradually withdrawing their money and shifting it into money market funds and other investments, banks are facing a squeeze. They’re being pressed to pay more for funding while their revenue is limited by the investments they made in low-yielding bonds during the pandemic. That in turn could curb their ability to lend to consumers and businesses, slowing the economy.

&gt;“They’re paying more for deposits, and their earnings on bonds are fixed,” said Stan August, a retired bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and a former bond analyst at Bank of America. “That’s where the squeeze is.”

&gt;When the pandemic hit, and the Federal Reserve pushed down rates once again by pumping unprecedented amounts of cash into the economy, many banks loaded up on long-term government and mortgage-backed bonds. There were some Treasury notes that promised to pay annual interest of just 0.6% over 10 years.

&gt;Then inflation surged and the Fed started urgently driving up interest rates. The value of those bonds plunged, because who would want to buy an old bond paying 0.6% interest when new ones were suddenly paying more than 3%?

&gt;Losses on bonds are a risk whenever rates go up, but banks’ holdings were bigger than usual in 2022. All that cash the Fed and the government pushed into the economy quickly found its way into the banking system, giving lenders trillions of dollars to invest. SVB’s domestic deposits, for instance, rose more than 150% from the end of March 2020 through the end of 2022.

&gt;Rising deposits on their own don’t necessarily represent a problem for banks. For SVB, they spelled trouble in part because its clients tended to keep large balances at the bank as a condition for receiving services like lines of credit.

&gt;That translated to a high percentage of customers’ deposits being bigger than US deposit insurance limits. Clients with high balances at a bank are often skittish about the safety of their funds. and more likely to withdraw money fast at signs of trouble.

&gt;There were at least three data points for SVB that worried depositors: the speed at which the bank’s deposits had grown, the high percentage of uninsured deposits it had, and the magnitude of losses relative to its equity. These factors helped create a perfect storm.

&gt;But even for banks that dodge the storm, bond losses are a problem. A large part of banks’ investment portfolios use an accounting method called “held to maturity” that ensures the firms don’t have to record any losses, or any hits to their balance sheets, from the declining value of their bonds. But they also have to hold onto the bonds until they mature.
Banks Locked Up Trillions in Long-Term Investments
Total holdings, at amortized cost, in held-to-maturity securities for banks with at least $25 billion in assets as of Q4 2022

&gt;As banks’ deposits started to grow during the pandemic, they initially plowed more money into bonds using a method of accounting called “available for sale.” For these securities, changes in the value of the bonds would affect their balance sheets but not their income statements. That accounting method can force banks to boost their capital levels, though, if their losses get too high.

&gt;In 2021, a growing group of banks believed the Fed would soon begin raising interest rates and began switching to counting more of their bonds as held-to-maturity. The biggest banks added about $1.7 trillion of the bonds to their books over the two years ended in December. In some cases, they switched bonds over from one accounting treatment to the other. In other cases, they just stopped buying new available-for-sale securities and only added to their held-to-maturity books.

&gt;Initially it worked pretty well. Profits ballooned. The US banking system’s return on equity, a measure of profitability, averaged 12.2% in 2021, the highest since 2006.

&gt;But now that inflation and rate hikes have come, banks have suddenly been finding themselves pressured from two sides. Higher interest rates forced banks to pay more money to win deposits, with average one-year CD rates rising to about 2.7% by March, according to DepositAccounts, from 0.35% in May 2022. Consumers and companies have been taking more of their money out of banks and investing it in assets like government bonds. Deposits in commercial banks fell last year for the first time since 1948, according to the FDIC. The worst pain here is for community and regional banks, which lost $109 billion of deposits in the week ended March 15, while the biggest banks have been luring funds.

&gt;Meanwhile, the value of banks’ bond holdings plunged on paper too. The $620 billion of unrealized losses in the system at the end of 2022 were for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities.

&gt;The combination of surging interest rates, high investment losses and heavy deposit outflows is new for most investors and executives in the banking industry. To many, this feels like uncharted territory.

&gt;“I have covered this industry for 20 years plus and I have never seen anything like this,” said Ania Aldrich, an investment principal at Cambiar Investors. “In all the stress testing we have done for at least the largest banks have never stressed for anything like this.”

&gt;Comments from banks

&gt;Charles Schwab Bank &amp; Charles Schwab Premier Bank

&gt;“Focusing attention on ‘unrealized losses’ in our held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio is very misleading. These ‘paper losses’ are unrealized and would only be realized if we had to sell those securities. The profile of our depositors is very different from regional banks. Given our significant access to sources of liquidity, there is a near-zero chance we’d need to sell any of our HTM portfolio prior to maturity. That would be akin to assuming a large retail bank would sell a substantial portion of its loan portfolio... Client deposits may move, but they are not leaving the firm. As is the case in every cycle, clients make choices about where to best allocate their assets. As interest rates have increased over the last year, our clients have made choices to reallocate assets within their Schwab portfolios, to reflect their preferences in this market. And in fact, we have actively encouraged them to do so. The important point is that those allocation decisions result in the assets staying at Schwab. Despite the events of the last two weeks, we have not seen any meaningful change in client behavior regarding their cash… Comparing unrealized losses across firms with different business models can be misleading. Schwab Bank has a different business model than traditional banks. Our deposits come from transactional cash in clients’ brokerage accounts that is swept to our banks. We use about 10% of that cash to fund loans to our existing clients and with the remaining 90%, we buy securities – the vast majority of which are backed by the U.S. Government. With rates moving up, the fair value of all fixed rate assets — loans or securities — has gone down. But given that our securities are very high quality, we fully expect our securities to reach par at maturity, which means the unrealized ‘paper’ losses will decrease over time. Because a much higher percentage of our assets are securities — and traditional bank loans are not disclosed the same way — our paper losses may appear larger than those of traditional banks. But that assessment lacks the appropriate context. In reality, our portfolio has less credit risk and is actually less sensitive to changes in interest rates than many large banks,” Co-Chairmen Charles Schwab and Walt Bettinger said in a statement.

&gt;First National Bank of Pennsylvania

&gt;“Due to FNB’s conservative balance sheet and interest rate risk management leading into this higher rate environment, the duration and fair value marks of our AFS and HTM portfolios were more favorable than others in the industry. Even after fully incorporating these marks into our Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio, we would remain well capitalized. In addition, FNB has a stable and granular deposit base and maintains a strong liquidity position with uninsured deposits excluding fully collateralized balances at only 27% and has available funding sources in excess of those balances,” CEO Vincent J. Delie, Jr. said in a statement.

&gt;Prosperity Bank

&gt;“Prosperity Bank has a fortress balance sheet that is well suited for times like this. In fact, we were a source of strength in the 80’s and 2008, participating in six FDIC assisted transactions. We are a traditional community bank with a diverse loan portfolio and a granular deposit base amongst the many communities that we are in. We have close to 800,000 deposit accounts with an average balance of $36,000, our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits only make up 32% of our total deposits, we have access to large amounts of liquidity, and we are extremely well capitalized. We maintain higher tangible common equity ratios than many of the large money center banks and remain well capitalized even if you include any unrealized losses in the held-to-maturity portfolio. It has been our pleasure to serve the communities we are in and help our customers navigate and understand all that is happening in the banking markets,’’ Cullen Zalman, senior vice president for banking and corporate activities at Prosperity Bank, said in a statement.

&gt;USAA Federal Savings Bank

&gt;“USAA is a fundamentally different bank than those that have struggled over the past few weeks. Our bank is consumer based, 93% of deposits are within the applicable FDIC insurance limits, and we have access to substantial liquidity to serve the needs of our members. USAA FSB also goes through rigorous stress testing to help us best support our members. Focusing on any single asset class is misguided, given additional ways to evaluate bank balance sheets, like net interest trends, which highlight the efficiencies or inefficiencies across a bank’s entire balance sheet. The degree of changes in USAA’s unrealized bond holdings is a reflection of a relatively low loan-to-deposit ratio, which means investments are a larger part of our balance sheet and accounting value fluctuations are more noticeable. But not all banks and not all investment portfolios are the same. Unrealized bond losses do not create excess risk in institutions with a stable base of customers, a strong capital position, the ability to hold such bonds to maturity and access to the liquidity necessary to meet their depositors’ and borrowers’ needs.”
First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co.

&gt;“First Citizens is a well-capitalized bank, and our post-acquisition capital ratios remain within or above our target ranges. In addition, the transaction is structured to maintain our position of strength with ample liquidity and credit loss protections. Our liquidity remains strong and stable driven by conservatively managed investment portfolio, and it is enhanced by this transaction.” First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. acquired Silicon Valley Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., though the sale did not include $90 billion in securities and other assets.
Huntington National Bank

&gt;“Per the company’s 10K, 68% of deposits at Huntington are insured / 32% are uninsured as of December 31, 2022. This is the lowest % of uninsured deposits among all US based publicly traded banks with $50bn+ in deposits (excluding those classified primarily as card issuers). Huntington has an active hedging program for securities, and total FV marks net of hedges for all securities are in line with peers.”

&gt;Northern Trust Co.

&gt;“Northern Trust is a global provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking to corporations, institutions, and individuals. Northern Trust has offices in the United States as well as 23 locations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region… Our clients leave large amounts of deposits with us not because we offer higher rates, but because they have significant payment activity. Over 60% of our institutional deposits are considered operational by regulatory standards… Northern Trust’s business model focuses on two core markets: institutions and wealthy individuals/families. These have been our historic strengths for generations. Retail banking represents a small percentage of our client base and an even smaller percentage of our assets on deposit, which in part accounts for the low percentage of insured deposits when compared with other banks that have significantly larger retail portfolios. Northern Trust is a Category II institution under the Federal Reserve’s regulatory framework. As a result, we are the only non G-SIB required to do daily liquidity testing and report unrealized losses in regulatory capital reporting. We consistently are assigned the highest long-term credit rating of any comparable U.S. institution. Northern Trust maintains a high-quality securities portfolio. Highly liquid assets constitute 62% of total client deposits as of Dec. 31, 2022. 81% of Northern Trust’s securities portfolio is composed of U.S. Treasury, government sponsored agency and triple-A rated securities. Regarding unrealized, mark-to-market HTM investment security losses as a percentage of tangible equity, it is important to note that our balance sheet composition has a lower proportion of loans, and thus our investment securities portfolio will be larger on both an absolute and percentage basis than banks with similar asset sizes.”

However, some investment  opportunities are undeniably controversial, raising a critical question:  is it ethical to invest in these industries, or should we strictly  focus on financial gains? 

This question arises when considering investments in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, weapons manufacturing, and fossil fuels. While these sectors have historically generated profits for investors, they also contribute to health, social, and environmental issues that affect millions of people worldwide.

Proponents of investing in controversial industries argue that:

1. Investors should prioritize maximizing their returns, regardless of the industry.
2. Investment in these industries could lead to positive changes, with shareholders pushing for more responsible practices.
3. Boycotting these industries may not create substantial change, as other investors may still fill the void.

Opponents, on the other hand, argue that:

1. Investing in controversial industries contributes to the continuation of harmful practices.
2. Ethical investing in industries such as renewable energy and sustainable agriculture has the potential for both financial gains and positive societal impacts.
3. Investors should consider the long-term consequences of supporting controversial industries, which may suffer from changing regulations and public sentiment. 

I would like to open up this discussion to the Reddit community. What  are your thoughts on investing in controversial industries? Is it a  necessary trade-off for high returns, or should we place more value on  the ethical implications of our investments?"|0.68|20|0|20

t3_126f86x|1680160221|investing|Advice for an overwhelmed 18-year-old! (Roth IRA's and more!)|"Hello everyone! Over the past couple of weeks, I have learned about the term financial independence, subsequently leading me down this rabbit hole of personal finance. In only a couple of days I have learned about Roth IRA's, Index Funds, and a plethora of other financial terms I never knew about previously. To start this off, I'll talk about my current ""financial situation"" 

I am currently a freshman in CC and paying practically nothing per semester, giving me much more financial freedom.

I currently work and have a car I paid for in cash. I have a monthly budget already set and I am fortunate enough to live with a family that will take care of any emergencies I might encounter! I feel like now is the best time to invest my money as I do not have any debt, high-cost bills, and people that are dependent on me. I plan on transferring to a UC (In state), so the cost of university will fortunately not be something I have to worry about, as I am again fortunate enough to have parents that will pay for my tuition. 

After I paid for my car, I have a total of 6k in my bank account. The second I turned 18 my father opened a credit card for me but put it under his name, meaning I am an authorized user. I am still building credit, but I am most definitely sure it's not as good as if I were to have it underneath my name alone.

Here is where my questions come in!

I have opened an account with fidelity, specifically an IRA Roth. It is my understanding that it is a retirement account to where I set aside my after-tax money into, and it has the benefit of providing tax free withdrawals after a certain age (59 or something like that). Within this IRA, I can invest in everything from mutual funds to even crypto currency (which I am definitely staying away from, at least for now). My question is, is it worth to put the majority of my money into a roth IRA? I am most definitely investing for the long game, but it is a bit crazy to me that I will not be able to take in the profits tax /penalty free until I am age 59. Is it worth opening a taxable account AND an IRA account, where I can invest in both with having the added benefit of being able withdraw money from my taxable account much earlier? 

Regardless, I am with fidelity, and I would be investing (in the IRA Roth at least) into FZROX, FSKAX, FZILX, etc (Obviously let me know if you guys recommend something else as I am speaking out of the very limited knowledge I have). Even when it comes to my taxable account, I would be investing in index funds/ETFS, and would dedicate a small percentage of my saved income towards individual stocks (just so that I could get more experience with the stock market in general). 

Also, just a side question, I hear so much about VTSAX, and that even though FZROX and VTSAX are extremely similar, FZROX can only be bought/and or owned at Fidelty. Is this really that big of a problem?

Sorry for the long post and I truly thank anyone who took the time out of their day to read through this! I was just in a pickle and did not know how much I should be investing/what accounts I should even be investing in. Any and all thoughts are appreciated, thank you!!!!"|0.75|37|0|37

As a normal guy holds a long-term view on investing, I used to make my investment plan projecting the next 10-20 years, hoping my portfolio will slowly but constantly grow to become something extraordinary. I understand the beauty of compounding and know how it can empower my performance over a longer period. A good investment plan should be feasible and reflecting the objective of what you are about to invest, with a reasonable mindset, and a long term (compounding) view. 

But few plans survived their first encounter with the real world. I plan, God laughs. When building up my future over the next 20 years I forgot to loop in those big things happened over the last 20 years: 911, 2007 financial crisis, COVID-19, etc. The first rule I just broke is:
- A plan is only useful if it can survive reality, and a future filled with unknowns is my reality.

Taking those unknowns seriously means I have to put a buffer into my plan in response to any kinds of catastrophe, there should have a room for failures where I don’t get upset when things don’t come out good. The second rule I will follow is:
- Having a margin of safety when making my investment plan, so I can still be happy in a range of outcomes.

t3_1269dog|1680145100|investing|Is pair trading superior to directional trading in volatile markets?|"Recently I read an article about the importance of pair trading (relative value). It got me thinking whether trading the market directionally is the best way to approach trading, especially in the current volatile environment. 

Here are a few snippets from the article I read on the topic which highlights the dangers of directional trading as opposed to pair trading. It was written during the Credit Suisse fiasco but remains valid for any type of volatility. 

Let me tell you what risks I see and why I think trading directional is a lot harder now.

* The CS fiasco may bring down other EU banks. First one that pops into my mind is DB.
* Many argue that CS will never be left to die because it is too big to fail European bank. I absolutely agree with this argument but would like to add that before a bail out happens there can be plenty more volatility to the downside, not just in the case of CS but other EU banks as well. Second the bail out may be conditional and nationalization may be in the cards which would automatically wipe out all equity holders and potentially hybrid holders. If that happens we have a monster drop in yields and rate hike expectations in Europe aka the squeeze continues.
* Alternatively, if you want to sell CS equity or debt because you are feeling bearish, you may get caught in the crossfire of news headlines. As you are aware SNB (Swiss National Bank) is providing a 50bn Swiss franc lifeline to CS which automatically means a huge squeeze of the shorts, not just in banks but in indices in general. There are so many ways to lose money in the current environment, if you are a directional trader, that I don’t think there are many cases in which it is worth doing it. Worst part of all? With directional risk you will be glued to the monitors day and night and wouldn’t be able to sleep at night.

The article is quite long but it is worth reading as there are several examples of pair trades and how this trader approaches pair trading in general."|0.75|6|0|6

&gt;Look deeper into the latest US banking crisis, and the cause may come as a surprise to anyone still thinking in terms of the crash of 2008. It wasn’t dodgy loans to impecunious homebuyers that sank Silicon Valley Bank. It was a stash of what are thought to be the safest securities on Earth: US Treasuries.

&gt;Those loans to the government were, of course, entirely safe in a very important sense. Uncle Sam is going to be good for the cash. (Set aside an unforeseen disaster with the debt ceiling—more on which in a moment.) But the final repayment date of SVB’s bonds was typically years away. The problem is what happens to their price in the meantime. Purchased during a time of ultralow interest rates, those long-maturity Treasuries were always liable to lose their immediate resale value if rates took off. Which they’ve done in a big way over the past year.

&gt;The Federal Reserve raised rates at the fastest pace in decades to tame inflation, pushing its key policy rate from about zero to a range of 4.75% to 5%. Treasury prices spiraled downward, since bond prices move in the opposite direction of rates. That’s only an immediate problem for someone who wants to sell a bond before it matures. Unfortunately for SVB, it fell into that category. Its clients, many of whom had much more than $250,000—the cap on federal deposit insurance—at the bank, got nervous and started yanking out their money. SVB could only sell Treasury holdings, as well as mortgage bonds backed by government agencies, at steep losses. The bank collapsed within days.

&gt;“We always refer to Treasuries as the world’s safest asset,” says Paul McCulley, the former chief economist for Pacific Investment Management Co. “That’s from the standpoint of credit quality. That’s not from the standpoint of asset price stability. There’s a huge difference.”

&gt;Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of Pittsburgh-based Bokeh Capital Partners, says she can’t get over how SVB bankers failed to spot the duration risk they were taking. “It’s kind of head-spinning,” she says. “They have to really know the parameters of what is going to happen to these bonds, given the forecasts for interest rates. What the heck happened? The supposedly bright people out in Silicon Valley couldn’t put that together and do a little calculus?”

&gt;Most banks don’t have as many uninsured deposits from jumpy tech startups as SVB did, but US lenders hold more than $4 trillion in government-backed securities. And Treasuries last year posted their worst losses since at least the early 1970s, with the longest-dated ones tumbling almost 30%. That’s one reason fear of bank contagion won’t go away, even after the Department of the Treasury, the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. swooped in to offer emergency protection for all depositors at SVB and New York’s Signature Bank, which collapsed around the same time. Policymakers haven’t said for sure whether other lenders will enjoy the same cover. Deposits have continued to flow out of banks—especially smaller, regional ones.
Losses Piled Up at US Banks as Rates Soared

&gt;The Fed loaned billions to banks after SVB’s collapse to ensure their liquidity, including new emergency programs that offered generous terms for borrowing against Treasuries and other bonds that had lost value. Essentially, the central bank—which already holds trillions of dollars’ worth of the low-yielding debt issued in the pandemic—was taking even more interest-rate risk out of the banking system.

&gt;But the Fed is also pushing ahead with monetary tightening. It raised rates another quarter of a percentage point on March 22. Bond prices have rallied anyway, because markets think Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues will change course. If they don’t, that could spell more losses for Treasuries—and more trouble for banks that hold them.

&gt;Rising rates aren’t the only problem in the $24 trillion Treasury market. Another is a long-standing concern about the market’s liquidity—essentially, the ease with which trades can be carried out. Many institutions and businesses count on the Treasury market to function smoothly. The past month’s fear and uncertainty has created near-unprecedented volatility, with the largest swings in some yields seen in 40 years. Liquidity was “significantly compromised,” JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. strategists told clients in mid-March, as trading in Treasuries surged to a record $1.5 trillion on one day.

&gt;There are various explanations of the liquidity problem. Treasury debt has ballooned by more than $7 trillion since the end of 2019, and there’s a widespread belief that the size of the market has outstripped the capacity of bank dealers to keep it orderly. Many say regulations imposed on banks after the 2008 financial crisis have also crimped dealers’ ability to keep enough bonds on hand to make sure buying and selling proceeds without hiccups. The Fed, Treasury and other regulators have been working for years on proposed fixes, but change has been slow in coming.

&gt;Then there’s the looming debt ceiling standoff—the possibility that politicians won’t reach a compromise on raising the nation’s self-imposed borrowing limit. Failure to do so before the Treasury runs out of ways to keep funding government spending could potentially trigger an unprecedented default on US public debt and throw a wrench into the global financial system that relies on Treasuries. The 2011 debt ceiling episode spurred S&amp;P Global Ratings to downgrade US government bonds from the top AAA rating, days after a deal to lift the limit and avert default was reached.

&gt;The recurring fights in Washington over debt limits may be one reason investors around the world have been showing more interest in potential alternatives to US Treasuries as a safe place to store wealth. Another is America’s aggressive use of financial sanctions, including the freezing of Russian central bank assets after the invasion of Ukraine, which has left some countries that hold lots of Treasuries wondering: Could that happen to us, too, someday? Global alternatives that sometimes get touted include old favorites such as gold, new monetary units based on commodity baskets, or the currencies of other large economies, like China’s yuan—even though it’s hard to make a persuasive case that any of them are better than Treasuries.

&gt;For many American investors seeking a risk-free asset, cash seems like the best option. Below the $250,000 cap on FDIC insurance, a bank account is reliable. But many individual and institutional savers alike have over the past months been seeking other options, like higher-yielding US money funds—which just attracted their biggest weekly influx since early in the pandemic. Those funds invest heavily in Treasuries, though at very short maturities that largely protect them from interest-rate risk. As rates go up, the funds can keep rolling over their holdings and pay investors the new higher rates.

&gt;How much more volatility is in store for Treasuries—and how much more damage the financial system suffers as a result—mostly hinges on the Fed. History suggests the US central bank has a poor track record when it comes to pulling off a major policy shift without something blowing up. SVB is already Exhibit A for this cycle.

&gt;McCulley recalls the wrecking of the US savings and loan industry in the 1980s—smallish mortgage lenders who went bust partly as a result of the same kind of duration risk that’s piled up on bank balance sheets today. He points out that the Fed has been raising rates at the fastest pace since back then, when former Chair Paul Volcker oversaw the inflation fight. And he says his key question for the Fed is this: “For the last year you’ve been channeling Paul Volcker. How much Volcker is too much Volcker?”"|0.48|0|0|0

&gt;As the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes sent bond prices plunging last year, some of the country’s largest banks used a simple accounting maneuver to help keep billions of dollars of losses from piling up on their books.

&gt;They declared that they intended to hold on to large portions of their money-losing bonds until they matured rather than selling them, and they then changed the bonds’ accounting labels accordingly. From then on, the bonds would be frozen in time, no matter how far their values fell in the market. 

&gt;The Wall Street Journal identified six large U.S. banks including Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW -1.84%decrease; and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. PNC 1.47%increase; that together switched the classifications on more than $500 billion of their bond investments last year. For some banks, excluding the unrealized losses from their balance sheets allowed them to report robust levels of capital when in reality their assets were worth much less. 

&gt;The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has drawn fresh attention to a decades-old debate over the accounting rules. Current rules often let companies show vastly different values for the same assets, depending on what they claim they intend to do with them. In addition, the rules often let companies change their stated intentions midstream, which can have outsize impacts on how healthy their balance sheets look.

&gt;The six banks were able to flatter their balance sheets with a flick of the accounting ledger. Banks can hold assets as “available for sale,” which means they are valued using market prices. Another option is to call them “held to maturity,” meaning they won’t be sold. These bonds are held at the banks’ cost. The logic is that daily market prices aren’t relevant to assets that banks wouldn’t sell.

&gt;The banks’ held-to-maturity bonds had a combined $1.14 trillion balance-sheet value as of Dec. 31, up from $681 billion a year earlier. The increase was mainly due to the reclassifications.

&gt;The $1.14 trillion figure was $118 billion, or 12%, higher than the bonds’ fair-market values, disclosed in footnotes to the banks’ financial statements. The $118 billion was equivalent to 18% of the banks’ total equity, which is the difference between assets and liabilities.

&gt;A year earlier, the difference between the held-to-maturity bonds’ market value and balance-sheet value was negligible. Most of the securities were backed by the U.S. government. The amounts of the reclassifications were disclosed in the companies’ financial reports. The Journal found the six banks using data compiled by S&amp;P Global.

&gt;The large gap between the stated values and actual values of banks’ assets has fueled growing concern about whether a significant portion of many banks’ capital is illusory. Capital is roughly synonymous with equity, and refers to the financial cushion a company has available to absorb future losses. 
Institutions including Charles Schwab changed the classifications of bond investments last year.Photo: Claudio Papapietro for The Wall Street Journal

&gt;The six banks’ reclassifications were part of an industrywide shift last year as bond prices fell. About 48% of securities held by U.S. banks were classified as held-to-maturity at the end of 2022, up from 34% a year earlier, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Unrealized losses on securities were $620 billion, of which $341 billion were on bonds dubbed held-to-maturity. The six banks’ unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities accounted for 35% of the industry total.

&gt;The biggest such reclassification was by Charles Schwab, which is structured as a savings and loan holding company and regulated by the Fed. It transferred $188.6 billion of securities to the held-to-maturity category from available-for-sale. Schwab wasn’t labeling any of its bonds as held-to-maturity at the end of 2021.

&gt;PNC transferred $82.7 billion of bonds to held-to-maturity from available-for-sale. JPMorgan Chase JPM &amp; Co. transferred $78.3 billion. Truist Financial Corp., TFC; Wells Fargo WFC &amp; Co. and U.S. Bancorp USB; transferred $59.4 billion, $50.1 billion and $45.1 billion, respectively.

&gt;“This is an artificial accounting construct, not an economic measure of the value of the assets,” said Sandy Peters, head of financial reporting policy for the CFA Institute, which certifies chartered financial analysts. “The value of a bond doesn’t change based upon how management decides to classify it. It’s worth what it’s worth.”

&gt;Silicon Valley Bank’s parent, SVB Financial Group, didn’t reclassify any securities last year, and most of its bonds were labeled held-to-maturity from the get-go. That meant SVB had locked itself into a long-term bet that interest rates would stay low. The unrealized losses on those bonds at year-end were almost as large as SVB’s $16.3 billion of total equity. It couldn’t sell the bonds without booking losses and taking hits to capital.

&gt;By the end of last year, the fair-market value of Schwab’s held-to-maturity bonds was $14.1 billion less than their balance-sheet value. The unrealized losses were equivalent to 39% of Schwab’s total equity. The unrealized losses exceeded Schwab’s $6.2 billion of tangible common equity, which is a bare-bones capital metric that excludes preferred stock and intangible assets.

&gt;A Schwab spokeswoman pointed to a March 23 open letter by the company’s co-chairmen, Charles Schwab and Walt Bettinger. “Focusing attention on ‘unrealized losses’ in our held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio is very misleading,” they said, adding that “there is a near-zero chance we’d need to sell any of our HTM portfolio before maturity.”

&gt;At Wells Fargo, unrealized losses on held-to-maturity securities were $41.5 billion, equivalent to 23% of total equity. At U.S. Bancorp, they were $10.9 billion, or 21% of total equity. At Truist, they were $9.9 billion, or 16% of total equity. The percentages at JPMorgan and PNC were 13% and 11%, respectively.

&gt;In their annual reports, most of the banks said they did the transfers to keep the fair-value changes out of their equity and capital metrics. In its annual report, PNC said it changed its intent for the securities “to reduce the impact of price volatility” on equity and capital. Truist said it made the transfers as the company “continues to execute upon its asset-liability management strategies.”

&gt;Wells Fargo said it made the transfers “to reposition the overall portfolio for capital management purposes.” JPMorgan cited “capital management purposes.”

&gt;Jeffrey Shelman, a U.S. Bancorp spokesman, said: “We are always making decisions to manage our balance sheet to ensure appropriate liquidity, balanced by the desire to mitigate the volatility that is associated with interest-rate movements.” Spokesmen for PNC, JPMorgan and Truist and a Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment."|0.91|518|0|518

t3_125fhmv|1680072009|investing|Exchange traded limited partnerships and state tax.|"Exchange traded LP's often offer an attractive return if you're after inflation adjusted income, rather than growth.

For example, WES   is returning nearly 9% piping gas around.

However, LPs are pass-through (no corporate tax, all of the income and deductions are attributed to partners), with a somewhat involved K-1 form.    No qualified dividends, but features like return of capital.   In Turbo-Tax, each K1 takes about 5 minutes.

And holding it in an IRA doesn't help if the 'other business income'  inside the IRA is over $1000, because then it's taxed at Federal level.   But maybe if they strive to keep actual income to zero (like my USA Compression partners, below) an IRA is fine, and solves a lot of issues. 

What worries me is the state tax implications.  If an LP makes money in a bunch of states, you *theoretically* have to pay tax in nearly all of them  [1].    In Maryland, for example, you have to file even if your partnership income is a loss.    Most states are chill about tiny incomes, but they can decide not to be.    My parents were hounded by Illinois, which was convinced they made a hundred or two there. 

I have a couple of partnerships (eg, USA Compression Partners), and the last K-1 lists losses in all states enumerated.  It still pays nicely, but accounting magic turns it into losses and return of capital.   Even these losses might need state tax returns, though.

And a mineral LP I have has royalty income in a bunch of states.  It's mostly Texas (no income tax), but also a dollar or two or twenty in  AL, AR, CO, ND, NM, OK, WY.

The Western Midstream LP I'm looking at says 

&gt; A distribution is paid by a partnership to its partners. Under the tax code, distributions are a return of capital and are generally tax-deferred. The cost basis in your partnership units (the amount you paid, increased or decreased by various adjustments) is lowered by the amount of the distribution. A dividend is paid by a corporation to its stockholders and is generally taxable in the year it is received.

This is nice - seems perfect for an IRA because the eventual negative basis won't be taxed at all - but the info is hard to find, and isn't the rule for all partnerships.

Does anyone here hold LPs?   What do you do about state taxes?    

Is a smart thing to ensure that they don't have any actual income (just return of capital), and hold them in an IRA?   But there's the catch 22 of seeing a K-1 before buying shares.

1. **KnightbridgeFX:** KnightbridgeFX is a foreign exchange company that allows you to convert CAD to USD. They typically offer better exchange rates than traditional banks and charge lower fees. The exact percentage you'll save will depend on the amount you're converting and the current exchange rate, but you can generally expect to save anywhere from 0.5% to 2% compared to a traditional bank.
2. **TransferWise:** TransferWise is an online money transfer service that allows you to convert currency at the mid-market rate with a transparent fee structure. They charge a small percentage-based fee on top of the mid-market rate, typically ranging from 0.5% to 1%. However, TransferWise doesn't support Norbert's Gambit, so you won't be able to take advantage of the potentially lower fees associated with that method.
3. **Norbert's Gambit:** Norbert's Gambit is a method for converting CAD to USD that involves buying and selling stocks in different currencies. It's a more complex method than using a foreign exchange company or TransferWise, and there are some risks involved. If you're comfortable with the process, you could potentially save money on fees by using this method. However, the savings can vary widely depending on the specific stocks and market conditions. It's difficult to provide a specific percentage range, but the potential savings could be significant."|0.67|3|0|3

This is due to the number of investing scams and financial misinformation that is prevalent on social media platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. There is and continues to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams on both Reddit and Discord - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate. 
2. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else. 
3. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. 
4. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
5. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

If you are in the US - you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser.  You can check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. 

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.


The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).


Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.


So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. 

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this."|0.94|666|0|666

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, my wife and I started making decent money and I was over-afraid of making mistakes with it, so I connected with a financial advisor at a large bank. Didn't know what I wanted, didn't know what I was doing, just wanted the confidence of someone educated keeping an eye on my finances. I'm now starting to feel like this relationship IS the mistake. The services and communication aren't great, and the more I learn on my own, the more I regret the 1% asset fee. I'm considering moving to a low-fee robo advisor and just chilling with index funds, but have a few questions/concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We have a managed investment account with them that's allocated mostly in ETFs. It's currently down about 6%. Can we move this to another brokerage without realizing that loss, or should we just consider it foregone and think of this as cutting our losses? 
2. We also both have IRAs with this firm. Should we be concerned about any interruption to compound interest in these accounts or our investment account?

&amp;#x200B;

Feel like we should ultimately make the move for our long-term best interest either way, but I guess I don't fully understand what happens during the transfer of hands (i.e. whether the investments stay intact or are somehow re-invested) and want to make sure I fully grasp any potential downsides.

248) You agree that all securities and other property in any account—margin or cash— . . . shall be subject to a lien for the discharge of all your indebtedness and any other obligations that you may owe to Merrill . . .

This is the view of Prof  Sabrin.  

*The job market may seem strong overall–but according to a long-term chart of the unemployment rate (above), layoffs tend to begin early in the recession phase of the business cycle, and then accelerate markedly as companies realize they must cut expenses to deal with the new economic reality of tight money and slowing demand.*

*When the unemployment rate reaches a trough as the economy peaks, it tends to “stabilize” at the lowest level of the cycle–and then it is off to the races.*

*When unemployment reaches politically intolerable levels, that’s when the Fed “pivots” and begins to lower the fed funds rate. Another easy money boom is ignited.*

*When will the Fed pivot? 2023? 2024? Later? It is too early to tell–but watching the unemployment rate ratchet up is the best indicator for the next episode of easy money and the next upswing in the economy.*

The key leading indicator is unemployment for second half of 2023. According to the article it will detoriate.    I hope that is not the case, but we should keep our eyes open."|0.4|0|0|0

&gt;On the surface, Charles Schwab Corp. being swept up in the worst US banking crisis since 2008 makes little sense.

&gt;The firm, a half-century mainstay in the brokerage industry, isn’t overexposed to crypto like Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank, nor to startups and venture capital, which felled Silicon Valley Bank. Fewer than 20% of Schwab’s depositors exceed the FDIC’s $250,000 insurance cap, compared with about 90% at SVB. And with 34 million accounts, a phalanx of financial advisers and more than $7 trillion of assets across all of its businesses, it towers over regional institutions.

&gt;Yet the questions around Schwab won’t go away. 

&gt;Rather, as the crisis drags on, investors are starting to unearth risks that have been hiding in plain sight. Unrealized losses on the Westlake, Texas-based firm’s balance sheet, loaded with long-dated bonds, ballooned to more than $29 billion last year. At the same time, higher interest rates are encouraging customers to move their cash out of certain accounts that underpin Schwab’s business and bolster its bottom line.

&gt;It’s another indication that the Federal Reserve’s rapid policy tightening caught the financial world flat-footed after decades of declining rates. Schwab shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since March 8, with some Wall Street analysts expecting earnings to suffer. 

&gt;“In hindsight, they arguably could have had more prudent investment choices,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Wong. 

&gt;Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger and the brokerage’s founder and namesake, billionaire Charles Schwab, have said the firm is healthy and prepared to withstand the broader turmoil. 

&gt;The business is “misunderstood,” and it’s “misleading” to focus on paper losses, which the company may never have to incur, they said last week in a statement.

&gt;“There would be a sufficient amount of liquidity right there to cover if 100% of our bank’s deposits ran off,” Bettinger told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday, adding that the firm could borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank and issue certificates of deposit to address any funding shortfall.

&gt;Through a representative, Bettinger declined to comment for this story. A Schwab spokesperson declined to comment beyond the Thursday statement.

&gt;The broader crisis showed signs of easing on Monday, after First Citizens BancShares Inc. agreed to buy SVB, buoying shares of financial firms including Schwab, which was up 3.1% at 2:29 p.m. in New York. The stock is still down 42% from its peak in February 2022, a month before the Fed started raising interest rates.
Unusual Operation

&gt;Schwab is unusual among peers. It operates one of the largest US banks, grafted on to the biggest publicly traded brokerage. Both divisions are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations.

&gt;Like SVB, Schwab gobbled up longer-dated bonds at low yields in 2020 and 2021. That meant paper losses mounted in a short period as the Fed began boosting rates to stamp out inflation.

&gt;Three years ago, Schwab’s main bank had no unrealized losses on long-term debt that it planned to hold until maturity. By last March, the firm had more than $5 billion of such paper losses — a figure that climbed to more than $13 billion at year-end. 

&gt;It shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities from “available-for-sale” to “held-to-maturity” on its balance sheet last year, a move that effectively shields those unrealized losses from impacting stockholder equity. 

&gt;“They basically saw higher interest rates coming,” Stephen Ryan, an accounting professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said in a phone interview. “They didn’t know how long they would last or how big they would be, but they protected the equity by making the transfer.” 

&gt;The rules governing such balance sheet moves are stringent. It means Schwab plans to hold more than $150 billion worth of debt to maturity with a weighted-average yield of 1.74%. The lion’s share of the securities — $114 billion at the end of 2022 — won’t mature for more than a decade. 

&gt;The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield now: 3.5%.

&gt;Cash Business

&gt;Schwab’s other headache from higher interest rates stems from cash.

&gt;At the root of Schwab’s income is idle client money. The firm “sweeps” cash deposits from brokerage accounts to its bank, where it can reinvest in higher-yielding products. The difference between what Schwab earns and what it pays out in interest to customers is its net interest income, among the most important metrics for a bank.

&gt;Net interest income accounted for 51% of Schwab’s total net revenue last year.

&gt;“Schwab’s counting on inertia,” said Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic, a financial-planning firm. 

&gt;After a year of rapidly rising rates, there’s greater incentive to avoid being stagnant with cash. While many money-market funds are paying more than 4% interest, Schwab’s sweep accounts offer just 0.45%.

&gt;While it’s an open question just how much money customers could move away from its sweep vehicles, Schwab’s management acknowledged this behavior picked up last year. 

&gt;“As a result of rapidly increasing short-term interest rates in 2022, the company saw an increase in the pace at which clients moved certain cash balances” into higher-yielding alternatives, Schwab said in its annual report. “As these outflows have continued, they have outpaced excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and pay-downs on our investment portfolios.”

&gt;In their statement, Bettinger and Schwab wrote that “client deposits may move, but they are not leaving the firm.”
FHLB Borrowing

&gt;To plug the gap, the brokerage’s banking units borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report filed with regulators.

&gt;Schwab borrowed an additional $13 billion from the FHLB so far this year, the filing showed.

&gt;Analysts have been weighing these factors, with Barclays Plc and Morningstar lowering their price targets for Schwab shares in recent weeks.

&gt;Bettinger and Schwab said that the firm’s long history and conservatism will help customers navigate the current cycle, as they have for more than 50 years.

&gt;“We remain confident in our client-centric approach, the performance of our business, and the long-term stability of our company,” they wrote in last week’s statement. “We are different than other banks.”"|0.7|714|0|714

I appreciate that we will always progress with technology but AI seems like such a big leap, I even read that it will take out a third of the US workforce in the next decade. Companies will be more profitable but the rest of the world would be screwed. High unemployment would mean housing market crash, high taxes, the government running more of a deficit due to social welfare spending as people will be out of working.

There's a T-bill maturing on a certain date (8/3/2023, 912796Y37) that's available in the secondary.  You can see what the bid-ask spread is (4.828-4.728 according to Fidelity).  So to buy it, you'd be getting a YTM of 4.728%.

A 17 week T-bill (912797GA9) is going to be auctioned this week, issued 4/4/23 with a maturity date of 8/1/2023 (if I did that correctly).

1. If you look up the Secondary closer to the auction date to get an updated yield/price, should you expect the yield of the New Issue to be somewhere in the middle of that spread?  (Meaning, it's always better to buy at Auction than in the Secondary market?)
2. The YTM for that Secondary is only showing as 4.704% when I look on Schwab.  So if you buy from the Secondary, does which brokerage you use matter?  Otherwise, why the difference?"|0.75|6|0|6

I went from lower income to around $1500 a week out of CDL school, and now have around $30k for the first time in my life.

- I'm 36 and tired of paying rent.  The first 3 years of trucking employment is touch and go too, it is normal to trade up a few jobs

- I want a starter home, but this flies in the face of most those homes have tripled value since the pandemic (extreme outside investment in my area). 

I feel a little left out not being able to get / flip a house, very unfortunate I didn't/couldn't in 2018-19.

So maybe I'm looking for agreements, disagreements, wise words, that I will continue to rent and put retirement money away, an emergency fund, and start a portfolio where I'm looking ahead less than five years.

I don't like the idea of gambling my down payment, but the home prices really do not make sense right now.  I could even move for better work.

So after about $6k in my Roth IRA and $2k in online HYSA, I have $20k I'm looking to start investing.  I would feel ok with half being more risky.

So I will be going with Schwab 

25% SVWXX, money market

25% SCHD, dividend fund

and then 

50% play the market, some index funds and be learning to buy some individual stocks

It's not much of a plan.  I just hate to think of my money being useless.  The ""original plan"" was to have a house, but I wasn't dealt a good hand really at the moment.

I recently opened a Solo(I'm self-employed) 401k through E\*Trade, and had a couple questions I was hoping to crowdsource.  I already have a Roth IRA that I max out through Fidelity.  40/40/20, SCHD/VOO/SCHY.  I wanted an additional investment vehicle that I could contribute Roth money, and E\*Trade was the only company, besides going through something like mysolo401k, that offered a Solo 401k account WITH a Roth option. 

1) Should I just mirror the allocations I hold in my IRA, or would there be benefit to holding different ETFs/stocks.  I want to continue a set-and-forget mentality with it, and slowly work into the budget maxing out the 23,500 yearly contribution. Once I can do that I will then work towards maxing out my SEP IRA through Fidelity. 

2) My income went up by 12k last year, all of which was in the 22% tax bracket.  Is there any advantage in investing 12k as a tax-deferred contribution(either through SEP IRA or 401k), to bring my taxable income back down to \~40K and save that 10% in taxes(12% vs 22%)? Or will it not matter in the big picture 20-25 years down the road? I dont forsee my income ever entering the 24% tax bracket. 

3) Is there any benefit to rolling my 401k into my IRA every year?  Or should I just let it ride in the 401k account?

While I don't expect my personal income (paid through my business) will fluctuate widely anymore, there is still a higher chance that this would happen in the future as my business goes through its ups and downs.

Does it make more sense for someone like me to own a higher proportion of high dividend yielding but low growth stocks? The thesis is that the dividends can act as supplementary income should I need it. Does that strategy make sense? Beyond dividend stocks, what else should I be putting my personal money into?

t3_121ip5d|1679742888|investing|Vanguard US Equity vs FTSE Global All Cap Index Funds|"
INB4 predicting the future, but I wanted to ask if you guys think the Vanguard US Equity Index Fund is *likely* superior to the FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund for a U.K. based investor? I did some analysis below that seems to indicate that this might be the case, based on existing returns, currency risk, and ongoing costs.

My assumptions:

Fund A (Vanguard US Equity Index Fund) average annual return: 15%

Fund B (Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund) average annual return: 10%

Fund A expense ratio: 0.1%

Fund B expense ratio: 0.23%

Investment period: 25 years

Initial investment: £10,000

Yearly contribution: £10,000, adjusted for 3% inflation

Salary increase: 3% per year

For both Fund A and Fund B, we will calculate the future value of the investment using the formula for the future value of an increasing annuity:

FV = P * (((1 + r)^n - (1 + g)^n) / (r - g))

where:

FV is the future value of the investment

P is the initial yearly contribution

r is the net annual return rate (annual return - expense ratio)

n is the number of years

g is the rate of increase in yearly contributions (salary increase - inflation)

Modelling without currency risk, based on historic performance:

For Fund A:

Net annual return after fees = 15% - 0.1% = 14.9% = 0.149
Increase in yearly contributions = 3% - 3% = 0% = 0.0

FV_A = £10,000 * (((1 + 0.149)^25 - (1 + 0.0)^25) / (0.149 - 0.0))

FV_A ≈ £1,838,336.32

For Fund B:

Net annual return after fees = 10% - 0.23% = 9.77% = 0.0977
Increase in yearly contributions = 3% - 3% = 0% = 0.0

FV_B = £10,000 * (((1 + 0.0977)^25 - (1 + 0.0)^25) / (0.0977 - 0.0))

FV_B ≈ £899,227.27

The difference in the future value of the investment between Fund A and Fund B is £1,838,336.32 - £899,227.27 = £939,109.05

Modelling with currency risk:

For simplicity, we will assume that the entire return for Fund A (Vanguard US Equity Index Fund) is subject to currency risk, while Fund B (Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund) has no currency risk as it is already globally diversified. Although this is a simplification, it will help illustrate the potential impact of currency risk on returns.

Scenario 1: No change in the GBP/USD exchange rate

In this scenario, there is no currency risk, so the future values of Fund A and Fund B remain the same as in the previous example: £1,838,336.32 and £899,227.27, respectively.

Scenario 2: GBP appreciates by 1% per year against the USD

In this scenario, we need to adjust the net annual return for Fund A by subtracting 1% to account for the currency risk: 14.9% - 1% = 13.9% = 0.139

FV_A = £10,000 * (((1 + 0.139)^25 - (1 + 0.0)^25) / (0.139 - 0.0))

FV_A ≈ £1,549,870.55

Scenario 3: GBP depreciates by 1% per year against the USD

In this scenario, we need to adjust the net annual return for Fund A by adding 1% to account for the currency risk: 14.9% + 1% = 15.9% = 0.159

FV_A = £10,000 * (((1 + 0.159)^25 - (1 + 0.0)^25) / (0.159 - 0.0))

FV_A ≈ £2,188,817.14

Comparing the future values of Fund A and Fund B under the three currency risk scenarios:

Scenario 1 (No change in GBP/USD):

Fund A: £1,838,336.32

Fund B: £899,227.27

Scenario 2 (GBP appreciates by 1% per year):

Fund A: £1,549,870.55

Fund B: £899,227.27

Scenario 3 (GBP depreciates by 1% per year):

Fund A: £2,188,817.14

Fund B: £899,227.27

Now obviously there are a lot of assumptions going on here such as historic performance and ongoing costs remaining the same into the future, however based on the information at hand, as well as my conviction that the pound will generally strengthen versus the dollar back to where it was but not far beyond, *and* that the US fund will outpace the Global one, I believe it stands to reason that the US fund is the one where it would be more rational to invest in. 

There’s the topic of diversification but both seem very diversified to me.

t3_121igwj|1679742255|investing|Is a key driver of whether stocks are over/under valued the rate at which people save money?|"
As a more simple analogy, consider bonds. As the price of a bond increases the yield on it will decrease. So if people have more money than they spend then the demand for bonds will increase and the yield on them will fall.

Similarly, the true value of a stock is the discounted value of all future dividends paid on it. If more people have idle money then more people will decide to buy stocks. This increase in demand will obviously drive up the price of a stock, but not on account of greater expectations for future dividends on it. Instead, the stock market will increase purely because people have little else to do with their money.

Arguably, increased investment in stocks will give companies more money to grow, etc, but presumably there will be diminishing returns on additional investment.

So more people entering the stock market will reduce the ROI on stocks (in the long-run). Furthermore, this fall in ROI will not drive investors out of the market, because there won’t be a better alternative use for their money (since interest rates will also be low if people have spare money they wish to save).

Is this analysis reasonable? Are there any obvious counter-arguments I’m missing?

TL;DR: In the context of investment, the value of money comes from its productive potential. If firms reach a point where they have little scope to use additional money productively, stock prices will become overvalued?"|0.6|2|0|2

t3_12121mu|1679698905|investing|Analysis: is blackstone's real estate fund BREIT actually significantly underperforming the real estate market?|"I was doing some research on REITs out of curiosity, particularly blackstone's BREIT due to its infamy, and stumbled on some fairly surprising results after doing a more involved analysis. It seems like when you simply account for their leverage, they actually underperform case-shiller index by **-20.5%** for the lowest fee share class**,** most of that difference probably eaten up by their high management fees. 

**Calculation**

Quick facts **(**[**https://www.breit.com/performance/**](https://www.breit.com/performance/)**)**

* created in Jan 2017
* reported leverage ratio of of 45%.
* management fees of **1.25% assets/year**, and 12.5% of gains.
* shown an apparent 104% return since 2017

To calculate return I use the numbers from BREIT's inception to the peak of the case-shiller housing index in June 2022  (I ignore numbers past the peak because of controversy surrounding BREIT's reported NAV since then - they claim almost no drop in value while other REITS are hammered). I also normalize for 45% leverage in BREIT's case. 

**Jan 2017 - Jun 2022 comparison**

Case shiller ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA))

308.4/184.7 = **167.0%** return

BREIT ([https://www.breit.com/performance/](https://www.breit.com/performance/))

201/1.45 = **138.6%** return              (1.45 as leverage-normalized base)

So case-shiller outperformed BREIT by (167.0-138.6)/138.6 = **20.5%** after you account for leverage.

Also, these numbers are for Class I shares - with the most favorable fee structure. Other share classes did even worse. In summary it looks like you would have done much better just holding something that tracks case-shiller with the same leverage (ignoring borrowing fees).

Isn't that kind of bad? I mean if you think of them as basically a leveraged housing index fund, it seems like no one has noticed their huge underperformance yet because there's been a permanent housing runup since it started (University of California even recently invested 4.5B with them) - but once it reverses, they will start taking leveraged losses no?

VMSXX is a cyclical and easy to follow MMF and for the next 1-2 weeks will likely climb to around 4%. 

While 4% does not seem like a lot, consider a tax bracket of 32% and add an additional 3.8% from NIIT. Now the tax equivalent yield is well over 6%. 

If you don’t want to spend a few minutes to do the exchange, you will be fine sticking with VUSXX, especially since it is the more stable of the two longterm.

Like many of you I have positions in a number of ETFs. While I know generally what each holds, I was thinking it would be good to come up with a way of compiling and updating a spreadsheet with the current holdings of a these ETFs- this would be extremely helpful in doing overall analysis on the portfolio. 

Does anyone know of a tool or method for doing this?

I would much rather invest in an MBS where I am going to get close to 7% returns (stock market level stuff) for 30 years.

($SQ) are overstating user counts and understating customer acquisition costs|"Full report: [Block: How Inflated User Metrics and “Frictionless” Fraud Facilitation Enabled Insiders To Cash Out Over $1 Billion](https://hindenburgresearch.com/block/)

Some selected points:

* Our 2-year investigation has concluded that Block has systematically taken advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping. The “magic” behind Block’s business has not been disruptive innovation, but rather the company’s willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government, avoid regulation, dress up predatory loans and fees as revolutionary technology, and mislead investors with inflated metrics.

* Our research indicates, however, that Block has wildly overstated its genuine user counts and has understated its customer acquisition costs. Former employees estimated that 40%-75% of accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.

* Core to the issue is that Block has embraced one traditionally very “underbanked” segment of the population: criminals. The company’s “Wild West” approach to compliance made it easy for bad actors to mass-create accounts for identity fraud and other scams, then extract stolen funds quickly.

* Even when users were caught engaging in fraud or other prohibited activity, Block blacklisted the account without banning the user. A former customer service rep shared screenshots showing how blacklisted accounts were regularly associated with dozens or hundreds of other active accounts suspected of fraud. This phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip hop songs.

* Block obfuscates how many individuals are on the Cash App platform by reporting misleading “transacting active” metrics filled with fake and duplicate accounts. Block can and should clarify to investors an estimate on how many unique people actually use Cash App.

* Beyond facilitating payments for criminal activity, the platform has been overrun with scam accounts and fake users, according to numerous interviews with former employees.

* The data shows that compared to its Ohio competitor, Cash App’s partner bank had nearly 10x the number of applicants who applied for benefits through a bank account used by another claimant – a clear red flag of fraud.

* Block reported a pandemic surge in user counts and revenue, ignoring the contribution of widespread fraudulent accounts and payments. The new business provided a sharp one-time increase to Block’s stock, which rose 639% in 18 months during the pandemic.

* In sum, we think Block has misled investors on key metrics, and embraced predatory offerings and compliance worst-practices in order to fuel growth and profit from facilitation of fraud against consumers and the government.

* We also believe Jack Dorsey has built an empire—and amassed a $5 billion personal fortune—professing to care deeply about the demographics he is taking advantage of. With Dorsey and top executives already having sold over $1 billion in equity on Block’s meteoric pandemic run higher, they have ensured they will be fine, regardless of the outcome for everyone else."|0.96|1421|0|1421

* Raised the benchmark policy rate by 25 bps to 4.75-5.00%

* Reiterated the 2023 terminal rate of 5.00-5.25% 

* Lowered expected 2023 unemployment rate to 4.5% from 4.6% prior

* Raised expected 2023 inflation (core PCE) to 3.6% from 3.5% prior, risks are to the upside

* Lowered 2023 GDP growth to 0.4% from 0.5% prior, risks are to the downside

**From the 2:30 PM EST Q&amp;A session (highlight points):**

* Inflation remains too high and labor market remains very tight, consumer spending seems to have picked up this quarter. Housing activity remains weak. Subdued growth to continue. Labor market expected to loosen. The path to 2% inflation will be bumpy. 

* Big focus on how tightening credit conditions (from bank crisis) will affect the economy. Further hikes will depend on how much the economy tightens as a result of the banking sector puckering up. Don’t know how things will play out. Prepared to use all tools if any more banking issues arise. 

* Significant number of people believe tightening in credit conditions will have the same effect as Fed policy. 

* Did consider a pause. Labor and inflation data stronger than expected, but banking stress has tightened in a similar way to some rate hikes. Otherwise would have hiked rates further over the course of the year. ""Public believes the Fed will be able to lower inflation. It is important that we sustain the public’s confidence with actions as well as words.""

* Disinflation is occurring unevenly. Goods inflation coming down for 6 months, admittedly more slowly than wanted. Housing services will come down given the lag in data. However, still don’t have progress in the non-housing services sector. Believes will have to soften demand and labor market conditions. 

* Base case does not see rate cuts this year. Looking to see how the credit tightening cycle plays out with respect to demand and the labor market, but if 5.1% is not sufficiently restrictive, the Fed will go higher. “In the end, we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2%, no one should doubt that."" 

* Recent liquidity provisions that increased the size of the Fed’s balance sheet are not intended to alter monetary policy and is not QE. Will not have the same impact on the economy as QE.

1. [Profit per unit of real gross value added](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A466RD3Q052SBEA) has blown up since 2000, from 5% to 16% of every dollar of value added (which is output value minus input costs, if I'm reading this right).

2. [Corporate profits as a fraction of GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Pik) are at near record levels, about 10%.   The historical norm might be 6%, but it shot up around 2007, fell sharply, then recovered and went higher.

3. [Buybacks and dividends](https://i.imgur.com/3e4mfg3.png) grew by a factor of about 2.5 from 2009 to 2019, and then shot up some more in 2020, with a lot of variation across industries.

I'm thinking this was driven by a mix of low rates and corporate tax cuts.

Another manifestation of this might be divergence between trailing-12-month P/E (a relatively sane 21), vs CAPE (very high at 28), suggesting that current profits are high compared to CAPE's 10 year window.

This makes me think the that the wonderful 10 year, 10%+ per annum nominal returns I've seen in some funds I want to buy (SPHD, VYM, SPY) was not driven by growth, but by better extraction of profits from existing production.    It seems earnings growth might be policy-driven, and thus unlikely to continue, and probably reversible.

In light of all the recent developments in the banking sector I wanted to see if someone here can help decipher some wording from the latest TD Bank (Ticker: TD) quaterly statements as it relates to a disclosure about their pending acuisition of First Horizon Corp (Ticker: FHN).

There is some wording around the mark-to-market of interest rate swaps that I can't quite get my head around and I'm hoping someone more familiar with the accounting and transactions of this type might be able to offer an opinion on just what is being captured.

The relevant section is from this document: [https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2023/2023-Q1\_Earnings\_News\_Release\_F\_EN.pdf](https://www.td.com/document/PDF/investor/2023/2023-Q1_Earnings_News_Release_F_EN.pdf)

Page 5 has the relevant information under the heading ""Pending Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation"" it has this text (my emphasis):

""The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships.

Since the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de- designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments.

**For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($998) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $122 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported $251 million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps.**

Based on the estimated financial performance and balance sheets of the Bank and First Horizon, including transaction-related impacts, the Bank expects that its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio will be comfortably above 11% upon the closing of the First Horizon acquisition.""

Q - So the question is, did they write down \~$1 Billion in the mark-to-market on the interest rate swap acquisition costs, is that correct?  And if so, does this suggest that they were holding a significant amount of long dated, low interest rate bonds and had to unload them at a substantial loss?

If I sell them before maturity on the secondary market do I get paid their accrued interest up to the sale date? I just sold some and it appears that accrued interest is paid.

For example:

I sold a $25K, 2.05% one year CD with 5/25/23 maturity date. It was reported at my broker as:

Sold 25 @ 99.026  with proceeds of the sale $25,180.54

25 x 0.99026 = $24,756.50

Does the difference between $24,756.50 and $25,180.54 ($424.04) mean that I was paid accrued interest. That is my guess.

If this is the case, that means that I can treat them sort of like no penalty CDs - plus or minus capital gain or loss due to interest rate changes.

As you may know, Google recently launched its new AI language model, Bard, which has created a lot of buzz in the tech industry. However, there are concerns that this new release could negatively impact Google's stock in the near future.

A few weeks ago, Google's stock experienced a dip after a demo of its AI technology got one of the questions wrong. Now, with the release of Bard, investors might be feeling uneasy about what this means for the company's financial future.

According to Google's FAQ, Bard is currently facing a few issues that might affect its performance in the market. Firstly, it's unable to keep track of context, which is a major limitation when it comes to generating coherent responses. Secondly, Bard can't write code, which is a significant setback for a company that's trying to automate as many processes as possible.

While Bard is an exciting development for Google and the tech industry at large, investors may want to keep an eye on the company's performance over the next few weeks to see how the market responds to this new release. It's important to note that Google has a solid track record of innovation and success, so it's likely that they will find ways to address these limitations in the future.

What are your thoughts on Google Bard's impact on the company's stock? Are you planning on investing in Google anytime soon? Thoughts?

First time poster, so apologies if I'm missing some crucial information--please just let me know. 

I'm about to open a 529 for our baby who is due in May. Given our long time horizon and that we only intend to have one child, I have a good stomach for risk and am interested in a fixed vs TD portfolio with a healthy mix of domestic &amp; international exposure. I've been reading the advice in this sub and from what I can tell, is there any reason to not park everything in Global Equity Market Index Portfolio (details here: [https://maryland529.com/Portals/0/Files/MCIP\_Disclosure\_Statement.pdf](https://maryland529.com/Portals/0/Files/MCIP_Disclosure_Statement.pdf), fund description page 36).

I also considered an 80/20 split of the Equity Index 500 and Extended Equity index, but then that leaves me with no international exposure as far as I can tell, because the Global Equity Market Index already includes investment into the 500 portfolio, which would be redundant.

They may feel ""safe"" because a lot of these companies are so identifiable with their physical brick and mortar branch offices and nice logos that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside but are these not the most dangerous places to invest? Look at SIVB, just a year ago flying high and now at $0. Nobody would have said a year or two ago that SIVB was a risky investment (certainly not riskier than Bitcoin) and yet you would have lost 100% of your money in 1 year with virtually no warning - turns out your money was safer at your favorite shitcoin. And there appear to be many other potential regional banks on the chopping block as well.

We also don't have to look too far back for more examples...Washington Mutual, Bear Stearns. And if the banks didn't totally collapse they probably faced other crises that wiped out most shareholder equity (2008 crisis has entered the chat).

What other kind of company can plummet to zero literally overnight? Tech companies usually have moats or at least patented technology that has some intrinsic value...when they fail it's usually a slow burn that you can see coming over multiple quarters/years (blackberry, yahoo, AOL, blockbuster), displaced by other smarter players for good reason. Then there's more traditional companies like Walmart, Chipotle, Starbucks, McDonald's, Costco...hard to see any of them plummeting to zero overnight short of some kind of fraud situation. Even biotech stocks aren't as bad...though they can certainly plummet to zero overnight, they aren't widely regarded as ""safe"" investments and investors know what they're getting into.

It just scares me to invest in a company that is essentially a black box, no matter how safe it may seem, the management levers up to the tits and if the wind briefly blows the wrong way (in this case the fed raising interest rates quickly - which was widely expected following hot inflation reports), you lose 100% of your money very rapidly. Or not, maybe everyone just gets spooked and decides to withdraw their funds despite the bank being health otherwise, and you still lose all your money - quickly.

If financial stability issues continue to mount, whether the Fed continues to hike through EOY 2023 becomes really doubtful. But inflation is still persistent and seems likely to double dip later in the year as cooling energy prices rebound and core CPI remains elevated.

So if the Fed is between a rock and a hard place w.r.t. hiking causing too much pain but inflation being persistent, it seems plausible they might just sacrifice fighting inflation in the medium-term of 1-3 years, or more permanently re-evaluate their framework and raise their inflation target to 3 or even 4%.

The purpose of this discussion is to strategize about the best plays to capitalize on an entrenchment of inflation expectations well above 2% over the next 1-2 years.

But going into the initial 2021-22 inflation spike the targeted fed/inflation trade was shorting treasuries because their value was directly tied to a continued low-yield environment which rapid fed rate hikes threatened (and I may have made a cool few grand off that insight). But are there similarly targeted trades available under this new set of circumstances (short of buying contracts on prediction markets for YoY inflation rates in 2023 and beyond)? Perhaps CPI futures where they exist?

t3_11xkwh5|1679413895|investing|As an individual investor, what risk do I have if my broker goes under?|"SIPC coverage limits are $500k per investor. Suppose I have more than that amount at Schwab. According to [their website](https://international.schwab.com/account-protection), they have excess SIPC coverage protecting individuals for up to $1.15M in cash and $150M in investments. So you'd think that has me covered.

But then they also say their policy ""provides protection up to an aggregate of US $600 million"". This seems to suggest to me that if Schwab were to go under, just four individuals with a 9-figure net worth would wipe out the insurance coverage for the rest of us. (This interpretation was validated by a Schwab customer service rep.)

I assume the money would be distributed proportionally across investors (or maybe even progressively in favor of smaller investors?), but the point is that $600M pales in comparison to schwab's $100B market cap or $7T assets under management.

So I wonder:

1. What are the realistic scenarios in which SIPC or excess SIPC coverage might be needed?

2. What is the likelihood of experiencing an event significant enough to require SIPC or excess SIPC coverage, yet not so significant that it wipes out the $600M limit? More to the point, **is excess SIPC coverage only for appearances?**"|0.9|403|0|403

So the savings account pays monthly, the idea is to have my money and gain the savings account monthly interest payout. After which I would open another CD account and start collecting daily interest from the account until it was time to move it back into my savings account.

It’s an odd situation as this is looking more and more like they are the rare 10% that will actually emerge from it.

I have received a letter from my broker on behalf of stretto regarding the filing of a proof of claim. I thought this would be for creditors rather than equity holders.

Online it says equity holders can file a “proof of interest” but I cannot find a way to do this only to file for “proof of claim” as per the letter.  

Proof of claim doesn’t really make sense at all to me, what would I claim? The dollar value I paid for the shares? The value of the shares as of the date of bankruptcy filing?

My main focus is to make sure that in the event the company finds a way to continue either with its existing shareholder structure or a new one that I am able to retain my fair shareholding as per the agreements they make.
